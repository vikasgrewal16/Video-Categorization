Lyrics:
Heroes to the rescue,
With my firefighter crew.
When there's danger,
We roll out!

Heroes to the rescue,
In our bright red hats, too.
Brave and daring.  
Here we come!

Heroes to the rescue,
Wearing sturdy strong boots.
Stomp on forward. 
Lets suit up! 

Heroes to the rescue,
Our firetruck goes ""woo"".  
‚ÄúWee-Ooh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWee-Ooh‚Äù. 
On our way!

Heroes to the rescue
Our fire hose goes ""woosh""         
‚ÄúWoo-woosh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWoo-woosh‚Äù 
Put it out!

Heroes to the rescue
It‚Äôs up to me, it‚Äôs up to you         
So heroic 
Save the day!

Heroes to the rescue
With my firefighter crew
When there's danger
We roll out!

Heroes to the rescue
With my firefighter crew
When there's danger
Save the day!

Let‚Äôs toss the ball and swing, swing, swing

Ready, set, go! And kick, kick, kick
Kick, kick as strong as you can
Ready, set, go! And kick, kick, kick
Kick, kick as strong as you can

We‚Äôll go out to the beach today
We‚Äôre going to laugh and play
On the sandy beach, under the sun 
We‚Äôll have so much fun!

Get on the board and paddle, paddle, paddle 
Paddle as best as you can
Get on the board and paddle, paddle paddle
Paddle as best as you can

We went out to the beach today.
We went out to laugh and play.
On the sandy beach, under the sun, 
We had so much fun!

Lyrics:
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Right there, right here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And We‚Äôll celebrate with treats
And balloons
Party all
afternoon!
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Up there, up here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll blow my candles out
Like this
Close my eyes
Make a wish
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Down there, down here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll party with my friends
And we‚Äôll dance
Wearing my
Party pants
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Out there, out here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
 
Mom, Dad, TomTom, Yoyo: Surprise!
 
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll give out lots of hugs
And I‚Äôll say
 
For today
 
Thank you, thank you, thank you...
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
In there, in here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll celebrate with my family
It‚Äôs a day
Just for me!

Lyrics:
Our pets love us every day
They bring us joy in many ways
We feed them, play and pet them too      
It‚Äôs how we tell them I love you!
 
When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
We could give them food to munch 
Yum yum yum, crunch crunch crunch! 

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat! 

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!  
Do they need to play, be pet or eat?
We could let them play outside!                   
Run run run, and exercise!                                        

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
We could gently pet their fur
Pet pet pet, purr purr purr!

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
They need our love in every way             
Love love love them every day!

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

Our pets love us every day
They bring us joy in many ways
We feed them, play and pet them too      
It‚Äôs how we tell them I love you!

Lyrics:
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
What will happen there?  

What will I see?
What will I do?
Can you tell me what will happen there?    
  
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist 
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
Your chair goes down and up!
It even fills up your cup!
Have you ever seen such a funny chair!            
                                              
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The mirror‚Äôs fun and shiny
It‚Äôs teeny and teeny tiny!
They‚Äôll check your gums are healthy everywhere!   
                   
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The toothbrush cleans your teeth                                          
Around and in between                                                        
It‚Äôs buzzy and it‚Äôs tickly here and there!                                                                                                                                         

You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The goody bag is so fun
You‚Äôll get one when you‚Äôre done!
There are goodies and surprises you can share 
                                                          
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
What will happen there?

Now I know
It will be great!
Now I know what will happen there!

Lyrics:
Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doc-tor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doctor ca-me with his bag and his hat.
And he kno-cked on the do-or with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head.
He said ""Miss Pol-ly, put him straight to bed"".
If you want to make him feel his best, best, best.
This dolly needs to go- get some rest, rest, rest.

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doctor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doc-tor ca-me with his bag and his hat.
And he knoc-ked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head
He said ""Miss Pol-ly, put him straight to bed""
If you want to make him feel his best, best, best
This dolly needs to go- get some rest, rest, rest.

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doctor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doctor came with his bag and his hat.
And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head.
He said ""Miss Polly, put him straight to bed"".
The dolly went to bed, and he slept all night,
And wo-ke in the morning, feeling quite alright!

Made of bamboo and wood

This is the Fula flute 
Move your fingers up and down
When you play this special flute 
It makes a sound!

These are African instruments
We play them in different ways
Let‚Äôs all make some MUSIC!
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs time to play!

This is the sangba drum
You lay it on the ground
When you hit the side and bell
It makes a sound

These are African instruments
We play them in different ways
Let‚Äôs all make some MUSIC!
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs time to play!

Lyrics:
Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Eve is coming soon;
Now you dear old man,
Whisper what you'll bring to me;
Tell me if you can.

Ho Ho Ho!

When the clock is striking twelve,
When I'm fast asleep,
Down the chimney broad and black
With your pack you'll creep;
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row;
Mine will be the shortest one;
You'll be sure to know.

Ho Ho Ho!

Mom and dad want grown up things
YoYo wants a dolly
TomTom wants a story book,
Christmas sure is jolly
As for me, it‚Äôs getting late
This ole Christmas night
Choose for me, dear Santa Claus,
What you think is right.

Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Day is here at last
And it‚Äôs time to see
What you brought to me last night
Underneath our tree

Ho Ho Ho!

While I tell of Yule-tide treasure.

I can't sleep I had a bad dream
I need mommy here with me
Daddy please! Stay by my side
I can't sleep, Although I tried
 
When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Hold your cuddle buddy tight
Cuddles help you sleep tonight

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Watch the night light glowing bright
Light will help you sleep tonight
 
Spoken (Cody): Mommy? Daddy?

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Mommy gives a hug so tight
Hugs will help you sleep tonight

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lyrics:
Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot  
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the shiny train cars
All in a row
Waiting to get hitched up
And go on their adventure
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See my favorite engine
Ready to tow
All the other train cars
Will follow on behind it
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
Climb on aboard
And hear the whistle blow
Mr. Conductor
Please take my ticket
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug puff puff
Off they go

See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go
Chug chug toot toot
Off they go

Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:
This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

Sometimes I play with a toy
Sometimes I play with a friend
But when I play with this box,* 
I get to play pretend!

This box is a tough turtle shell
Resting on top of my back!
I hide my turtle head inside‚Ä¶
Then poke it out for a snack!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

This box is a big bongo drum!
I bang it to play a song
I go TAP TAP, I go BOOM BOOM
I stomp and I sing along

This box rocks!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

This box is a speedy race car!
ZOOMing and VROOMing around
Pickles is the race car driver
And I‚Äôm in charge of the sounds:

ZOOM! VROOM! BEEP! BEEP!

Pickles SFX: MEOW

SCREECH!
...There‚Äôs a ladybug crossing the street!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

These boxes will get recycled soon
But while they‚Äôre still here with me
We‚Äôll close our eyes and think about
All the fun things they could be‚Ä¶
All the fun things these boxes could be!

Lyrics
Let‚Äôs learn a special way 
To stretch and calm ourselves today
Spoken: This is called yoga!
Spoken (Children): Yoga
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
Stretch your body, move about
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
When you stretch, pretend to be
Like a cat! Follow me!
Arch your back to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high.
Spoken: Meow!
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
When you stretch, pretend to be
Like a tree! Follow me!
Stretch your arms to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken JJ: Whooosh 
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
As you stretch, pretend to be
Like a dog! Follow me!
Lift your doggy nose to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken JJ: Woof woof!
 
When it‚Äôs hard to keep our cool
Stretching is a useful tool
 
As you stretch, pretend to be
Like a giraffe! Follow me!
Lift your shoulders to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken: Stretch!
 
Learning the Easy Pose/Butterfly Pose
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
Stretch your body move about
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
Spoken Miss Appleberry: It‚Äôs called yoga! 
Spoken Children: Yoga!

Going on a doggy hunt.

Mud!

Can‚Äôt go under it
Can‚Äôt go through it

I gotta go under it!
Swish swash, swish swash

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?

Wind!

Can‚Äôt go over it
Can‚Äôt go under it
Can‚Äôt go around it
I gotta go through it!
Whoosh woo whoosh woo!

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?


Oh look! On the couch! 
What‚Äôs this?

Something funny.
With a long soft thing on its end
With two big ears
And a cold wet nose

Slightly longer interlude
It‚Äôs Bingo!.

Slurpy slurp, slurpy slurp.

C‚Äômon Bingo! I have a surprise for you!

Run through the wind! 
Go under Dad! 
Slosh around the mud! 
And give your best dog a‚Ä¶ a... 

Huh?...

Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
To our good dog!

Lyrics:
The itsy bitsy birdie was looking at the ground        
Whoosh! Went the wind and the tiny bird fell down    
Out came the family  
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie was scared as could be
Cheep Cheep! She called out for her family
Out came the kids
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?
    
The itsy bitsy birdie was wrapped up safe and sound
Cheep! Called her mama seeing she‚Äôd been found
Out came the ladder
To help their birdie friend 
How will  itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie looked up at the tree
Up Up! Went daddy, brave as can be
Out came Mama bird
To see her baby‚Äôs friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie‚Äôs
Nearly home again!      

The itsy bitsy birdie was safely tucked away
Hooray! Cried the family, and helped her on her way
Out came the rope
To help their birdie friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie
Was safe at home again!

The big brave daddy turned to leave
Clatter! Went the ladder, where his feet should be 
Out came a, YIKES
Can you guess what happened then?

The big, brave daddy
Was safe at home again!

Lyrics:
How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
with glitter paint and glue
Sometimes we say it
With words and what we do
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La-la-la, 
La-la-la, 
La-la, 
La-la, la-la-la,

How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
With things we made ourselves

Sometimes we say it
With a smile, kiss or cuddles!
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La, la, 
La-la, la, 
La-la, la-la, 
La-la,

How can I show you 
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
When we listen and are kind
Sometimes we say it
With chores, and spending time!
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La-la-la, 
La-la-la, 
La-la, 
La, la, la,

How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?


Sometimes we say it, 
With patience and friendship 
Sometimes we say it
With dancing and music
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

Lyrics:
Out in the barnyard, tractor rides.
Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here
Neigh neigh neigh - says the horse
Neigh neigh neigh - says the horse  

Out in the barnyard, tractor rides.
Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here,
Cluck cluck cluck- says the hen
Cluck cluck cluck- says the hen  

Out in the barnyard, tractor rides. 
Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here,
Moo moo moo - says the cow
Moo moo moo - says the cow 

Out in the barnyard, tractor rides. 
Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here,
Oink oink oink - says the pig 
Oink oink oink - says the pig  

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year!

Someone hiding low
On your tiptoes go, go, GO!
It‚Äôs hide-and-seek, in the snow!

For winter show and tell I love to dance ballet
Playing in the snow

Yummy sugar cookies

Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

Autumn veggies start out small
With our help they grow up tall
Veggies help us grow up too 
That is why we love harvest stew!
 
I can‚Äôt find my carrots! Just this green stuff!
 
Carrots hide under the ground
Pull one up, what have you found?
A long and pointy, orange root 
For our harvest stew
 
Pumpkins sitting on the ground
Pick one up, what have you found?
Something heavy, round and smooth
For our harvest stew
 
My tomatoes are small and green!

Ms. Appleberry: They‚Äôre not ripe yet, but it‚Äôs ok, we can use mine!
 
Tomatoes resting on the vine
Pick one off, what did you find?
Something round, red and smooth!
For our harvest stew
 
Potatoes sleep under the ground
Pull one up, what have you found?
Something rough and hard to chew (spoken)
For our harvest stew 

Autumn veggies start out small
With our help they grow up tall
Veggies help us grow up too 
That is why we love harvest stew!

You‚Äôve had a lot of fun

Some quiet things...you can do  
It‚Äôs quiet time...for me and you!

For me and you

Spent time out in the sun
If you don‚Äôt feel your best

Some quiet things...you can do

Lyrics:
Let‚Äôs go for a nature walk
Listen to the birdies talk
Go strolling in the grass
While clouds go rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

Short and leafy forest trees  
Tall and pointy forest trees 
Forest trees stand happily 
As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Red and orange autumn leaves
Green and yellow autumn leaves
Autumn leaves dance in the breeze
As we‚Äôre whistling
 
**Whistles catchy tune**

Sweet and tiny flowers bloom
Big and happy flowers bloom
Can you smell their sweet perfume

As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Flapping, chirping birds go by
Swimming, quacking ducks go by
Floating free and flying high
As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

We went for a nature walk
Listened to the birdies talk
Went strolling in the grass
While clouds went rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

Lyrics:
Three hungry piggies
Rumble rumble rumble¬†
Their little tummies growl, growl, growl!
One tricky wolf¬†
Sneak sneak sneaks
He gives a hungry howl...

This little piggy went to market
To buy fruit of all kinds
This little piggy went to market
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
This little piggy stayed at home~
He baked a yummy apple pie
This little piggy stayed at home~¬†
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
Wally takes the roast beef
This little piggy had~ roast beef
He had them all, piled up high
This little piggy had~ roast beef
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
These little piggies, they had none
The wolf took off, and ran away
These little piggies, they had none
So the piggies made a ‚Äúplan, plan, plan!‚Äù
¬†
These hungry piggies
Spoken: Plan plan plan
To get their dinner back
¬†
The hungry wolf went
Spoken: yum yum yum
The piggies tip-toed by! 
¬†
Three tricky piggies
Spoken: Sneak sneak sneak
Their little tummies growl‚Ä¶
¬†
This tricky wolf went ‚ÄúWah, wah, wah,‚Äù
Hungry and alone
These little piggies went ‚ÄúWee weee!
All the way... ‚Äúhome, home, home!‚Äù

Looky-look! a little snail
Crawling on the ground
Looky-look!  a bunny hops
Bouncing up and down

Looky-look! a silly goose
Eats berries one by one
Looky-look!  a hairy moose
The berries are all gone

With our thumbs and fingers too
We‚Äôll make a shadow puppet zoo!

Looky-look! A happy cow
Listen to her moo
Looky-look! a big gray wolf
Howling at the moon

Looky-look! An elephant!
His trunk sways to and fro
Looky-look! A Spooky Spider!
A Spider!? Yikes! Let‚Äôs Go!

When it‚Äôs dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Lyrics:

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your weight, she‚Äôll check your height
She‚Äôll check to see that you‚Äôre growing right

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your lungs, she‚Äôll check your heart
She‚Äôll make sure they‚Äôre working, every part

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your eyes, she‚Äôll check your ears
She‚Äôll check how well you see and hear

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your mouth, she‚Äôll check your throat
She‚Äôll look at her checklist and make some notes

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your reflex, she‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy, and how much you‚Äôve grown

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

Now she might say that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared, it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

So exciting, I could dance!
Just like magic, watch them grow
I love to watch our garden grow!

Let‚Äôs grab our shovels!

Spread some soil all around
So roots can grow deep in the ground
Grow and grow baby seeds
Grow up tall as can be!
 
Make a hole in the ground
Plant your seeds and pat them down
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Plants get thirsty just like you
Water gently, that will do!
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Plants get hungry, yes they do
They use the sun to make their food!        
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Let‚Äôs be patient, wait and see!
One day they‚Äôll sprout up happily!
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet

This is our class pet
We found Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet

Instructions
To make a paper airplane we need:
A sheet of paper
Crayons
And that‚Äôs it! Are you ready?

Step 1. First, take your sheet of paper
Now find the SHORTER sides
Take one SHORT side, match it with the other
With one hand, HOLD the top
And with the other hand, make the fold

Step 2. Unfold your paper. Now find the LONG side
Is this the LONG side?
Take one CORNER and drag it to the MIDDLE fold
With one hand, HOLD the corner down
The other hand can make the fold
Now take the other CORNER
 Then drag it to the MIDDLE fold
With one hand, HOLD the corner down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 3. See how it looks like a house?
Now fold it in half
 With the FLAPS on the OUTSIDE
Lay it on it‚Äôs side
Look! This is the MIDDLE POINT
Drag it down to match the BOTTOM fold
Use one hand to hold the point down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 4. Now flip the whole thing over!
And we‚Äôll do the same thing on the other side
Find that MIDDLE POINT again
This one!
Then drag it down to match the bottom fold
Use one hand to hold the point down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 5. Almost done!
Now let‚Äôs decorate our airplanes
And color it with our favorite things
Coco-you coco-me coco-1, 2, 3!

Step 6. Your airplane is ready!
Thanks for crafting with us!
See you again on Yoyo‚Äôs Arts and Crafts Time!

Pounds it flat while rolling round
Rolling, Rolling! It‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done
 
The concrete mixer blends and spins
All we need to make cement
Blending, Spinning, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

The rumbly dump truck drops and loads
What we need, down the road
Dropping, Loading, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

The great tall crane lowers and lifts 
Heavy things, smooth and swift
Lowering, Lifting, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

Let‚Äôs make our own construction site
We‚Äôve got the tools to do it right
We‚Äôll push and mix, smash and scoop

The excavator scoops and drops
Lots of dirt, cement, and rocks
Scooping, Dropping, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

The big bulldozer pushes ‚Äòround
Dirt and rubble on the ground
Pushing, Pushing, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

Let‚Äôs build a bed for our big boy
A new bed that brings lots of joy
Our screws go in with a twist twist twist
Follow the steps on the list list list!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

Turn it clockwise, Righty-tighty 
Counterclockwise, Lefty-loosey
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey
Wow! It‚Äôs really easy!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

We built a bed for our big boy
A bed that brings him lots of joy
The screws went in with a twist twist twist
Did all the steps on the list list list!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! there‚Äôs something wrong!

We‚Äôve made a bed for our big boy
A bed that brings him lots of joy
Turn on the night light: one, two, three
So you can sleep and dream dream dream

10 dinosaurs in a row
Count them while they‚Äôre stretching

I‚Äôm on a white horse
Holding my sword and shield
To fight the dragon
Down on the battlefield

It‚Äôs time to read now

They‚Äôre cotton candy

If you leave your tooth alone

But new teeth will grow -- someday

My baby teeth will fall away
But new teeth will grow -- someday

Look my tooth is loose, see?

Let‚Äôs taste with our mouths!

It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side
On a white and snowy ride
Sliding down the bunny slope
Soaring, smiling wide

Place your boot in from the toe
Then you push your heel down low

We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

Do the duck walk in your skis
Form your skis into a ‚ÄúV‚Äù
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Make a pizza shape, okay
Help your skis to make an ‚ÄúA‚Äù
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

Ride the magic carpet up
Then we‚Äôll ski down from the top 
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go! 
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Let‚Äôs go down the bunny slope 
Not too fast and not too slow
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

Watch as mama bird helps them to fly!
Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:
Five little eggs were sitting in the nest
On top of the tree and all at rest
Mama bird saw them starting to crack
And soon all the eggs were hatched

The 1st baby bird looked down at the ground
He got scared and couldn‚Äôt make a sound
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird was too shy shy shy  

The 1st baby bird got out of the nest
The Next baby bird looked at the rest 
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said oh my my my

The 2nd baby bird flew way up high 
The Next baby bird then gave a sigh
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said too high high high 

The 3rd baby bird at last went out
The Next baby bird then gave a pout
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said oh why why why 

The 4th baby bird went down to eat 
The Last baby bird gave a long loud tweet
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird wanted to cry cry cry 

Mama bird said it‚Äôll be okay, 
you‚Äôll be alright and there‚Äôs a way  
The Little baby bird then started to sing 
And flew off flapping his wings 

All the baby birds with mother in the lead
Flew through the sky quite well indeed
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
And all the birds flew to the sky sky sky

Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on my right.

It‚Äôs so fun to learn what
Lives at the beach!
These are the things that

I look in the sky and what do I see?
A white seagull flies over me.
Soaring, diving, flap, flap, flap
Flap like the seagull, flap, flap, flap

I look at the sand and what do I see?
A little red crab walks right by me
Crawling, Creeping, click click clack
Crawl like a crab, go click click clack

I look in the tidepool and what do I see?
Clamshells yawn in the deep blue sea
Opening, Closing, snap snap snap
Snap like a clam go snap, snap, snap

I look at the shore and what do I see?
A sea turtle wiggles on the sandy beach 
Flippers waving, swish, swish, swish
Wave like a turtle, swish, swish, swish

I look at the beach and what do I see?
Dolphins play in the waves so free
Jumping, diving, splish, splish, splash
Jump like a dolphin, splish, splish, splash

Lyrics:

We‚Äôll go out to the field today
We‚Äôre going to run and play
We‚Äôll be on a team and have a race 
We‚Äôll have so much fun

We went out to the field today
We went out to run and play
We were on a team and had a race
We had so much fun

Jump on the ball and bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce as fast as you can
Jump on the ball and bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce bounce as fast as you can

Let‚Äôs grab the rope and tug, tug, tug
Tug, tug, as hard as you can
Let‚Äôs grab the rope and tug, tug, tug
Tug tug  as hard as you can

Put on the sack and jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump as fast as you can
Put on the sack and jump, jump, jump
Jump jump as fast as you can

Pick up a bean bag, toss, toss, toss
Toss, toss as close as you can
Pick up a bean bag, toss, toss, toss
Toss toss as close as you can

Take the baton and run, run, run
Run, run as fast as you can
Take the baton and run, run, run
Run run as fast as you can

Lyrics:

I have a Puppy
His name is Bingo
I have a Puppy
Cute as a rainbow!

I love his tail 
and smiling face
He makes me happy
In any place!

‚ÄúCome Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

We run and play
If he could pick,
His favorite game
Is ‚ÄúGet the stick!‚Äù

‚ÄúBingo! Fetch!‚Äù   
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

I lost my lamb  
The other day 
Bingo found it! 
‚ÄúHip Hip Hooray!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

I train him to 
Do some cool tricks 
He is so smart   
He learns them quick! 

‚ÄúShake Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

And on the days
Bingo is bad
I wag my finger
It makes him sad

‚ÄúNo Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúNext time, outside‚Äù

When I am sick  
Or feeling blue  
He stays by me  
Through and through 

‚ÄúThanks Bingo‚Äù

We love our Puppy
Yes, it is true.
We love our Puppy
He loves us too.

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He tells me silly stories and tucks me in at night
He helps me not to be afraid when he turns out the light

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He‚Äôs always playing music, and lets me sing along
He also dances with me, and sings my favorite songs

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He always takes us places, like camping or on hikes
He taught me how to catch a fish and helped me ride my bike

Your Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
Your Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He listens to my problems, he knows just what to do
He‚Äôs my biggest hero,  It‚Äôs true!

Our Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
Our Daddy is the best, and we love him just because
He always takes good care of us, he‚Äôs kind as he can be
He‚Äôs the greatest Daddy that we have ever seen!

I love to be your Daddy
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
You fill my life with lots of joy
You‚Äôre my favorite girls and boys!
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
I love you!

Lyrics:

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I am sick or hurt, she gives a great big kiss
She helps me to feel better and she does it just like this

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She takes the time to play with me, all my favorite games
Even when she‚Äôs busy, she loves me just the same

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I get hungry, she makes my favorite snacks
She makes them just the way I like, they‚Äôre great and that‚Äôs a fact

Your Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Your Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She laughs when I am silly, and likes to play along
We sing and dance together to all our favorite songs

Our Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Our Mommy is the best, and we love her just because
She always takes good care of us, and she should be a queen
She‚Äôs the greatest mommy that we have ever seen

I love to be your mommy
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
You fill my life with lots of joy
You are my precious girl and boys
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
I love you!

When you get that funny feeling
Way down low
Just stop what you‚Äôre doing
And go go go!

What are you doing?  Where did you go?
What are you doing?  I want to know!
I went to the potty, and washed my hands too
I went to the potty like the big kids do!

How do I do that?  How do I go? 
How do I do that?  I want to know!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I‚Äôm sitting on the potty, ready to go
But nothing is happening, and why, I don‚Äôt know
Try again later, it‚Äôs okay,
Try again later, later today

I‚Äôve got the funny feeling, way down low
I‚Äôve got the funny feeling, I think I have to go!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I went to the potty!  Look and see!
I went to the potty, hooray for me!
Great job, J.J., now wash your hands!
Great job, J.J., now do the potty dance!

Great job, J.J., do the potty dance
I/we got you some big boy underpants
When you get that funny feeling way down low, 
Stop what you‚Äôre doing and go, go, go!

He‚Äôll check how well you see and hear

He‚Äôll check your mouth, he‚Äôll check your throat
He‚Äôll look at his checklist and make some notes

He‚Äôll check your reflex, he‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy, and how much you‚Äôve grown

Now he might say that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared, it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:

In the summer the ants were a-working
Bringing food to their hill every day
While the grasshopper sang in the sunshine
On his fiddle, his song he did play.

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I will sing all the while ‚Äòneath the sunshine!
‚ÄòNeath the moon, I will dance, I will play!‚Äù

In the autumn the ants were still working
But the grasshopper still did not care
The ants asked ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you store food for winter?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs cold, you‚Äôll have no food to spare.‚Äù

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
‚ÄòBove us all, there will always be sunshine
And there always will be time to play!‚Äù

Time went by, and along came the winter
And the wind gave a cold icy chill
Snow fell down, and there was no more sunshine
So the grasshopper went up the hill.

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I am cold, I am wet, I am hungry
And I‚Äôm sorry I played the days away.‚Äù

In the valley he went to the anthill
He was cold, and embarrassed, and sad
But the ants told him that he was welcome
Then he thanked them and felt really glad!

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day!‚Äù
And the grasshopper said in future seasons
Work comes first, then he‚Äôll have time to play!

465,The Tortoise and the Hare | CoComelon Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs,"Who‚Äôs going to win the race, the speedy hare, or the slow tortoise?  Have fun singing along with this classic story! (Alt title: The Hare and the Tortoise)
 

Lyrics: 
Once there was a very very speedy hare
Once there was a very very speedy hare
He would brag from near and far 
That he was faster than a car
Oh yes, one time there was a very speedy hare

The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so fast in running shoes,
Then there‚Äôs no way that you can lose,‚Äù
Oh yes, the tortoise said to Hare ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race‚Äù

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

All the animals came down to see them run
All the animals came down to see them run
With a bell the race began
And fast away the quick hare ran
Oh yes, the animals came down to see them run

The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
Since the hare so quickly sped,
He had by now run far ahead
Oh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
Since he thought he couldn‚Äôt lose,
He laid right down to take a snooze
Oh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win

The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
He passed by the sleeping hare,
Who kept on snoring, unaware
Oh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
The sleepy hare woke up and ran
As fast as speedy quick hares can
Oh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line

Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Oh yes the hare was very fast
But even so, he came in last
Oh yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race

Lyrics: 

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow

And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules

It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school

So the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
So the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near

And he waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And he waited patiently
‚ÄòTill Mary did appear

Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Love Mary so, love Mary so?
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children cried

Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
Lamb you know, lamb you know
Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
The teacher did reply

Violin is high, not low
And you play it with a bow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The tuba sounds so low,
So take a breath and blow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
When you play upon a flute
It makes a happy toot,
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
Play the xylophone with sticks
The notes are short and quick
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The harmonica is small
The smallest one of all
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
They all play with the beat
As they‚Äôre marching down the street
They go:

Lyrics:

Rock a bye Baby in the tree top
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall
And down will come baby, cradle and all

Baby is drowsing, cozy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings

Rock a bye Baby, do not you fear
Never mind, Baby, Mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep until morning light

Lyrics:

When you start to have the hiccups and they just won‚Äôt go away
And you really really really wanna stop
Try to hold your breath, so the hiccups cannot stay
If you really really really wanna stop

Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop

When you start to have the hiccups ‚Äòcause you ate your food too fast
And you really really really wanna stop
Just take a drink of water, you can sip it from a glass
If you really really really wanna stop

Take a sip (*Hiccup!*) 
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop

When you start to have the hiccups and you don‚Äôt feel very well
And you really really really wanna stop
Just ask a friend to help you, to sneak up on you and yell
If you really really really wanna stop

Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)

Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)

And you really really really wanna stop
Just wait a little while, they might leave you on their own
If you really really really wanna stop

Wait it out (*Hiccup!*)
Wait it out 
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Wait it out 
Wait it out 
If you really, really, really wanna stop

The other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain 
Was all that he could see

The bear went over the river

The bear went over the river
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the other side of the river
The other side of the river
The other side of the river
Was all that he could see

The bear went into the forest
The bear went into the forest
The bear went into the forest
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the other side of the forest
The other side of the forest
The other side of the forest
Was all that he could see

The bear went back to the treehouse
The bear went back to the treehouse
The bear went back to the treehouse
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the stuffy right there in the toy box
The stuffy right there in the toy box
The stuffy right there in the toy box
Was all that he could see

Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:

The three little kittens, they lost their mittens,
And they began to cry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we sadly fear,
Our mittens we have lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Lost your mittens?  You naughty kittens,
Then you shall have no pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have no pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens, they found their mittens,
And they began to cry,
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have found!‚Äù
‚ÄúPut on your mittens, you silly kittens,
And you shall have some pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have some pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens put on their mittens
And soon ate up the pie.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we greatly fear,
Our mittens we have soiled.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Soiled your mittens?  You naughty kittens!‚Äù
Then they began to sigh.
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then they began to sigh.

The three little kittens, they washed their mittens
And hung them out to dry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have washed.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Washed your mittens?  Such good little kittens,
I smell a wolf close by.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
We smell a wolf close by.‚Äù

Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:
There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse liked to eat oats and beans
The City Mouse liked to eat cake and cheese
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse listened to the bugs and birds
The City Mouse listened to the cars and trucks
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse looked at the moon and stars
The City Mouse looked at the signs and lights
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse lived near the fields and trees
The City Mouse lived near the shops and streets
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse invited the City Mouse
The City Mouse visited the Country Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse showed his friend the country 
The City Mouse talked about the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse said, ‚ÄúPlease feel at home‚Äù
The City Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse invited the Country Mouse
The Country Mouse visited the City Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse showed his friend the city
The Country Mouse was chased by a kitty
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse said, ‚ÄúPlease feel at home‚Äù
The Country Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

554,Three Little Pigs | CoComelon Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs,"Look out!  Here comes the Big Bad Wolf!  The three little pigs each hide in their houses made of hay, sticks, and brick, but will they be strong enough to stand up to the wolf‚Äôs huffing and puffing?  
Subscribe for new videos every week:  

Lyrics:
 
Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the first didn‚Äôt care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the second didn‚Äôt care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn‚Äôt fall, fall, fall
So the work didn‚Äôt bother him at all.
 
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
 
‚ÄúLittle pig, little pig, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on my chinny-chin chin!‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
And boy, did the hay house go!
 
‚ÄúLittle pigs, little pigs, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on our chinny-chin chins!‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
And boy, did the stick house go!
 
‚ÄúLittle pigs, little pigs, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on our chinny-chin chins !‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
But the bricks surely did not go!
 
The wolf was at his wit‚Äôs end, you see
He climbed on the roof, down the brick chimney!
He came with his teeth all bared, bared, bared
So the three little pigs got scared!
 
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising, higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, OW! OW! OW!
And the wolf ran out of town!
 
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard-worked job won‚Äôt fall fall fall
To a huff, or a puff, at all!
 
The three little pigs went out that day
Now they were free to laugh and play
The Big Bad Wolf was gone gone gone
And the little pigs danced ‚Äòtil dawn!

And you really, really, really wanna sneeze
Don‚Äôt worry too much, it could just be the weather
When you really, really, really wanna sneeze

They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
They twirl in the water using their fins
It makes them so happy, see how they grin

Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
Mom nudges baby with her big snout,
Then up to the surface, breathe with a spout

Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
They‚Äôre happy together all the day long,
They swim in the ocean, singing this song

How many pairs inside?
We‚Äôll look through the box and match all the socks
Oh how many pairs inside?

I found a sock, believe it or not,
With big yellow polka dots!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For big yellow polka dots!

I found a sock, it was almost lost,
That‚Äôs fuzzy wuzzy, warm and soft!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For fuzzy wuzzy, warm and soft!

I found a sock of a different type
With orange and purple stripes!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For orange and purple stripes!

I found a sock, and it makes me glad,
It‚Äôs red and blue in plaid!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For red and blue in plaid!

I found a sock, that‚Äôs how it goes
With holes for all my toes!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For holes for all my toes!

I found a sock so my feet won‚Äôt freeze
All the way up to my knees!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For all the way up to my knees!

I found a sock, you bet, that‚Äôs right,
That‚Äôs just plain gray and white
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match 
For just plain gray and white

We came at last to the bottom of the box, 
To the bottom of the box of socks!
Look at all the pairs that we found in there,
It‚Äôs the bottom of the box of socks!

One fell down, it was slippery like soap,
No T-Rexes climb the rope, climb the rope!

One T-Rex is on the rings, on the rings
One T-Rex is on the rings, on the rings
He fell down, oh, look how far he swings, 
No T-Rexes on the rings, on the rings!

Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high
Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high
They fell down, but they gave it one more try
Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high!
Ten T-Rexes reached the sky, reached the sky!

Dinos as lively as they can be
But one egg‚Äôs stuck in a tree
Get it down
Dinos as lively as they can be
They have ideas, you see
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos they jump all at once to see
If a quake will shake the tree
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Oopsie! The fruits fell right out the tree
Sticky as fruits can be!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos they swing like in a trapeze
They think that this is a breeze!
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Hey now! Don‚Äôt let go so quick-a-ly!
Look, now! You just missed the tree!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos, they stack one on top of each
Stretching, just so they can reach
Poor Eggy!
Whoa there! You think you can reach the top?
Yippee! Be careful, don‚Äôt drop!
Dinos, they finally did succeed
Working as a dino team!
They got Eggy out from the tree
Dinos why don‚Äôt you see
What is inside the last egg!

Grass, grass, fills the nest
Mud, mud, sticks the rest

Five little birds are out today
Learning how to sing-o
Tweet, tweet, loud and clear
Chirp, chirp, have no fear
Peep, peep, so all can hear
They‚Äôre learning how to sing-o!

Five little birds are out today
Learning how to dance-o
Hop, hop, up and down
Twist, twist, all around
Stomp, stomp, on the ground
They‚Äôre learning how to dance-o

The seaweed is swaying,
And we‚Äôre down here playing
The whale tries to hide in a cave
He won‚Äôt fit inside
‚ÄòCause his head is too wide
There‚Äôs his tail, we can all see it wave

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
The whale tries to hide in the reef
But hey there, look out,
We can still see his snout
Look, he‚Äôs right there behind that small leaf

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
He hid by the old submarine
He couldn‚Äôt get in,
We can still see his fin
He‚Äôs so sad that we hear sniffling

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
Let‚Äôs all try to find a new game
Blue‚Äôs too big to hide
But he makes a great slide
He is big, but we‚Äôre friends just the same

Let‚Äôs explore the awesome planets,  
We‚Äôll fly in our rocket ship!
Let‚Äôs explore the awesome planets,
We‚Äôll have an exciting trip!

CHORUS:
All eight planets travel in orbit
We‚Äôll get to know them, every one!
Solar system, solar system
Planets spin around the Sun

Mercury is the smallest planet, the
Very first one that we see, it‚Äôs
Really hot with lots of craters,
Just as dry as it can be

Venus is the second planet
Shining brightly in the sky
Having lots of clouds and gases
Makes it hot and bare and dry

Earth is third, it is our home
There‚Äôs oxygen and water here
Everything we need for living
Plus a moon that‚Äôs very near

Mars is fourth, the planet that is
Red with rust all o-ver, we
Wanted to explore this world, so 
We sent up the ro-ver

Jupiter is really big, it‚Äôs
Made of many ga-ses
It has sixty-seven moons, see
Each one as it pa-sses

Saturn is the next big planet, the
One with all the pretty rings
They‚Äôre made up of ice and dust, they‚Äôre
Particles of bigger things

Uranus is the seventh planet,
Mostly made of ice and gas, it‚Äôs
Really cold, and spinning sideways,
Hit by something in the past

Neptune is the final planet, it‚Äôs 
Color is a pretty blue
Having lots of wind and cyclones
Makes it very cold, it‚Äôs true
