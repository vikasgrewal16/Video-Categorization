This course is also available in the Hindi Language on  @CodeWithHarry   channel. JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

Your feedback really makes me very, very happy.
This course is divided into 13 chapters and three projects. Out of these three projects, we have two projects as our games, and one of the projects is a Django Jumbo website. We will learn to make a website in this course as well!
If I were to suggest one language that can help you do a wide variety of tasks, that would be Python.
Yes, friends, that's the beauty of Python.
Since the evolution of Python, many things have changed; many operators have been introduced, and many new concepts in Python, like f-strings, have been introduced.
We are going to see the updated concepts of Python throughout this course. 
For your ease and help, I have also included a cheat sheet with this course. I will give you the PDF of the handwritten notes. All this is for free; You don't have to pay me anything.
For your convenience, I have also timestamped this video to see the chapters and navigate to the different parts of this video using the YouTube features.
