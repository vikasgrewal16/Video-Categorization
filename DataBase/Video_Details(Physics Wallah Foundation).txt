Crops are plants grown by farmers. Agriculture plays a very important role in the Indian economy. It is the backbone of our country. 70% of the Indian population depends on agriculture for food and money. 
It is the major occupation in rural areas. The cultivation of crops depends primarily on the weather and soil conditions.
India is geographically very vast, hence it has various food and non-food crops which are cultivated in three main cropping seasons which are rabi, Kharif, and Zaid.
India is an important center of rice cultivation. Rice is cultivated in the largest areas in India.
The crops that are grown to feed the human population are known as food crops.

Battle of Plassey is a battle fought between the East India Company force headed by Robert Clive and Siraj-Ud-Daulah (Nawab of Bengal). The rampant misuse by EIC officials of trade privileges infuriated Siraj. The continuing misconduct by EIC against Siraj-Ud-Daulah led to the battle of Plassey in 1757.
The Battle of Plassey occurred when Nawab of Bengal Siraj-Ud-Daulah did not like the uncontrolled use of privileges by the East India Company’s officials. Also, the company workers stopped paying the taxes, which became one of the reasons for the Battle of Plassey.

49,Class - 8th Physics Demo lecture by Alok Sir | Umang Batch,"Class 8th Umang Batch:  

This is the demo lecture of class 8th Physics by Alok sir.
We have covered the following topics in this lecture.
0:00 - Introduction
3:30 - Electric  charges
12:52 - Electric current
21:39 - Conductor
24:38 - Insulator
27:13 - How electric current flow
36:38 - Thank you

Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes charged matter to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. 
Electric Current is the rate of flow of electrons in a conductor. The SI Unit of electric current is the Ampere. Electrons are minute particles that exist within the molecular structure of a substance. 
A conductor is a substance or material that allows electricity to flow through it.
An electrical insulator is a material in which electric current does not flow freely. The atoms of the insulator have tightly bound electrons which cannot readily move.

We have covered everything you need to know while chosing Lawyer or Judge as a career such as the qualifications required, duration of the course, which entrance exam is required, what are the top colleges of the field chosen, fees, salary that you can earn, what to after , and many other similar questions.

A judge is responsible for deciding the fate of the plaintiff and the person accused.  While a few roles are carried out in the courtroom during trials, a lot of the work like seeking opinions, research, discussion of cases are carried out behind curtains in chambers. 

The primary thing to start a career in Law as a Judge is to earn a Law degree. An undergraduate degree in Law or an LLB degree is a prerequisite for anyone to prosper in the field. 
A number of reputed law schools around the world offer LLB courses which marks the beginning of your journey to Judgeship. To get admission to prestigious Law schools in India, you need to qualify CLAT exam. But if you are planning to undertake legal studies abroad in top schools like Harvard, Yale, Oxford or Cambridge, you need to get a valid score in LSAT exam. Preparing for LSAT can be a daunting task but scoring good in the exam can surely guarantee you the best education in the legal domain.

Chartered Accountants are one of the most prestigious professionals in India when it comes to the non-technical field. In today’s world when the commerce field grows more and more in demand, chartered accountancy offers one of the brightest career opportunities. The CA course comprises education in the field of business, taxation, accounting, and auditing required to excel.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is the national, professional accounting body of India. Founded back in 1949 under the Chartered Accountancy Act, it remains to this day the only statutory body to regulate the profession in India. Now, how to win their approval? The ICAI exams.

We have covered everything you need to know while chosing Scientist at ISRO or NASA as a career such as the qualifications required, duration of the course, which entrance exam is required, what are the top colleges of the field chosen, fees, salary that you can earn, what to after , and many other similar questions.

If you are aiming to become a scientist it is best if you start your preparation right after school. Choose your field of interest in science and narrow it down to a particular niche. However, the first step to the process is to choose between PCM or PCB right after your 10th board exams. It is vital to be very good at math if you are aspiring to be a scientist. A specialization in maths is required because of research in general deals with statistics.

Have a clear idea as to the niche area that you want to pursue. Select your bachelor’s degree keeping in mind the assorted options like Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, Social Sciences and more. You may also pursue professional courses like  B.Tech, B.Sc, B.Pharma, etc. in your interested subject.

We have covered everything you need to know while chosing Indian Navy, Airforce or Navy  as a career such as the qualifications required, duration of the course, which entrance exam is required, what are the top colleges of the field chosen, fees, salary that you can earn, what to after , and many other similar questions.

There are four main entries to get into Indian army. In your final year of Graduation, you need to pass the Combined Defence Services Exams, clear the SSB, be medically fit and join IMA as a Direct Entry if you come in merit. The other entries are 10+2 Tech Entry where you apply after your 12th Exams.

To join Indian Navy there are some criteria similar to that of the Indian army. Similar to other forces the navy officers enjoy all privileges and powers in the Indian society.

NDA is more like a recruiter who screens and selects the best candidates for all three armed forces of India, viz. Indian Naval Academy, Indian Air Force, and Indian Military Academy.

Navy also has an entry point similar to Technical Entry Scheme for Army. Male candidates who had passed 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry and Maths scoring a 70% aggregate shall apply for this.

300,क्या नसो का खून नीला होता हैं? | Why do our Blood Vessels Appear Blue? | Physics Wallah #Shorts,"Have you ever wondered why our blood vessels appear green or blue even though our blood is red? 
A human body has 3 types of blood vessels. When ray from blood reaches our eyes they have to go through a thick layer of tissue and since red light has a shorter frequency as compared to violet, blue and green, therefore red light cannot penetrate through our skin.

376,Why Does Our Hair Turn Grey and White? 🤔 | Science | Physics Wallah #Shorts,"In this Youtube Shorts, we will take a look at the most common causes of grey and white hair.
As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color — like gray, silver, or white — as it grows. People can get gray hair at any age.

Here is an overview of this chapter for you to have a better understanding during the Live Session.👇🏻
 
The extract ""Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" is taken from the autobiography of this great man. It is a touching account of the horrible atrocities and oppression inflicted by the heartless white rulers on the innocent black natives in South Africa.

Mandela shares a few of his bitter experiences during his struggle against apartheid along with the overwhelming emotions he experienced when a democratic era was finally ushered in after years of struggle.
