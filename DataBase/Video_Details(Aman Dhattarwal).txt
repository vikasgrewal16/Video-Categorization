How to prepare for Class 12 English :  

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Sunday released the date sheet of Class 10 and class 12 examination 2019 on its official website.

According to the date sheet, Class 12 board examination will be held from February 15 to April 3, 2019 while the Class 10 board examination will be held from February 21 to March 29, 2019.

While preparing the date sheet, the board has tried to take care that students get sufficient time between the examination of important subjects. It has also kept in mind that the dates of competitive examinations may not coincide with the boards examinations.

The board has also kept in mind the Delhi University admission schedule as per orders of the Delhi high court.

The board has tried to conduct early the exam of subjects offered by small number of students so that less number of schools are involved and disturbed.

The CBSE has also tried to give students maximum time to prepare by early announcement of date sheet.

For Re-checking, CBSE has used the phrase “CHANGE IN MARKS”, therefore, in case there is a drastic totaling error, i.e in totaling if your marks reduce by 5-10 marks then there is a slight possibility that the examiner might reduce your marks.
Generally, it never happens, but still, do not apply for verification if you believe that the examiner has done justice with your mark sheet.

 IIT-Bombay (Physics Department)-Pursue 4 year Engineering Programme in Engineering Physics followed by a 2 year M.Sc. Programme in Physics. Besides this IIT-B also offers 2 dual degree programmes - B.Tech- M.Tech in Engineering Physics and M.Sc.-Ph.D in Physics. The Ph.D. programme is much sought after, with over about 50 research students currently enrolled in various research programmes. The Physics department at IIT Bombay also undertakes cutting edge research in Physics ranging from Nano Sciences to High Energy Particle Physics.
· Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (TIFR)-TIFR functions under the umbrella of Department of Atomic Energy under the GOI and also undertakes researches in other fields like Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemistry etc. While the main campus is located in Mumbai, there is a TIFR Pune campus, TIFR Bangalore campus & TIFR Hyderabad campus as well. The TIFR Mumbai campus offers Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics with specializations in X-Ray & Gamma Ray Astronomy, Infrared and Optical Astronomy and Theoretical Astrophysics.

D programs. M. Tech in Physics, M. Tech in Opto-electronics and Optical Communication, M. Tech in Solid State Materials, M. Tech in Applied Optics are some of the coveted programs.
IISc and HBNI are other options
I would suggest you to start your career as a B.Sc. graduate then go for the M.Sc in any reputed universities (JNU, DU, BHU, Madras University) instead of choosing a dual B.Sc-M.Sc degree. Then try to clear the competitive exams like CSIR, UGC.
Few of the specialized Fields to pursue Physics in Post Graduate program are -
· Acoustical Physics
· Astrophysics
· Astronomy
· Biophysics
· Fibre Optical Physics
· Fluid Physics
· Geo-physics
· Materials Physics
· Medical/Health Physics
· Molecular Physics
· Nuclear Physics
· Optical Physics
· Plasma Physics
Majority of the job opportunities post your studies in Physics would require you to be involved in academics but here are a few job types you can look at:
· Consulting Physicist
· Research Associate
· Radiation Oncologist
· Radiologist
Some of the employment areas:
· Research Institutes
· Laboratories & Institutes
· Agricultural Research Services
· Hospitals
· Power Generating Companies
· Aviation Industry
· Construction firms
· Demolition Squads
· Pyrotechnics Manufacturers
