Vertical pupils can be found in dogs, cats, vipers, geckos, crocodiles and some birds. Goats, sheep, deer, horses, frogs and toads have horizontal pupils. One advantage to slit-like pupils is that they allow the iris to contract and expand more dramatically.

Birds fly hundreds or thousands of miles as they search for food or migrate and they do a pretty good job of not getting lost on the way.  Certainly better than me.

We learn how scientists learned about these senses and more, and we answer the question, ""How do birds navigate?""

Do you know?
Our own Human cells commit suicide ! Yes you read it right.

Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death. It is used during early development to eliminate unwanted cells; for example, those between the fingers of a developing hand. In adults, apoptosis is used to rid the body of cells that have been damaged beyond repair. Apoptosis also plays a role in preventing cancer.
