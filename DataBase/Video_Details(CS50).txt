An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

28,CS50x Nicaragua - CS50 Educator Workshop 2022,"Presented by Silvio Duarte — Code Program Director, Fundación Uno, Nicaragua

We will learn about the history of CS50 Nicaragua, the project that began with the most passionate students about technology at the National University of Engineering thanks to Fundación Uno and that to date has taught CS50 to more than 3,000 people in the country. We will see how the program has grown so much that we now also teach CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (Web50x.ni), Scratch and Robotics for children studying in elementary school.

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and ""debug"" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

She is the Curator of Mammals in the Museum of Comparative Zoology and an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her research focuses on understanding evolutionary diversity in mammals. Her research has taken her around the globe, including studies of grizzly bears in Yellowstone and rodents in Chile and Argentina.
Professor Hoekstra attended high school in Northern California and received her B.A. from UC Berkeley and her Ph.D. from the University of Washington. She has received many awards for her scientific contributions, most recently the Lounsbery Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. In 2016, she was elected into the National Academy of Science. She also teaches in Harvard’s introductory Life Science course Genetics, Genomics and Evolution to approximately 400 first year students each year.

When Darwin proposed the idea of evolution by natural selection, there was one piece of his theory missing.  Today you'll find out what that is, how it was solved, and what we have learned since."
56,Raj Chetty - Visitas Thinks Big 2022 - Harvard University,"Professor Chetty is the William A. Ackman Professor of Economics at Harvard University and the Director of Opportunity Insights, which uses big data to study the science of economic opportunity: how we can give children from all backgrounds better chances of succeeding? Chetty has received numerous awards for his research, including a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship and the John Bates Clark medal, given to the economist under 40 whose work is judged to have made the most significant contribution to the field.

Prof. Chetty's talk will illustrate how social scientists are using the tools of ""big data"" to tackle some of the most important social and economic problems of our time, focusing specifically on how we can improve equality of opportunity and restore the American Dream."
57,Beth Blum - Visitas Thinks Big 2022 - Harvard University,"Professor Beth Blum is an assistant professor of English at Harvard University. Her book, The Self-Help Compulsion: Searching for Advice in Modern Literature, explores the surprising overlap between the history of literature and the self-help industry. In the book she explores how Samuel Beckett might be a guru for business executives and James Joyce offers advice for living the good life. She frequently teaches James Joyce, the ""Harvard Novel,"" a course that covers literature and film where the Harvard campus serves as the narrative setting, and as part of the Humanities Colloquium.

Professor Blum will speak about how the stoical technique of ""therapeutic redescription"" can help us understand literature and improve our lives."

61,Serverless 101: Preparing for modern application development - CS50 Tech Talk,"AWS Serverless technologies are changing the way developers design and create web applications. From startups to enterprises, developers are building production ready applications without having to provision or manage the underlying infrastructure to support them. Companies like CapitalOne, iRobot, Taco Bell, and Netflix rely on AWS serverless to power their online businesses. In fact, Amazon builds over 50% of all new applications using serverless.

With more and more companies migrating to cloud and a serverless-first approach to application design, companies are seeking developers with the right skill set. In this session, I introduce you to serverless. I discuss the concepts behind the technology and introduce you to the services that are the building blocks of modern applications. Finally, I build a simple application to demonstrate the speed of prototyping that is possible with serverless.

At the end of this session, you will have a basic understanding of serverless technologies and event driven architecture. You will also be provided resources to continue learning about serverless and how to start using it in your current and future projects.

Presenter: Eric Johnson, Principal Developer Advocate, AWS Serverless

80,An Invitation to CS50x Puzzle Day 2022,"CS50x Puzzle Day is an online adaptation of an event we hold at Harvard each year, an opportunity to collaborate on a team with classmates, family, and friends on a packet of puzzles (i.e., logic problems). The event is open to everyone around the world, whether taking CS50 or not. No prior CS experience required. Teams of size 2, 3, or 4 are encouraged, or you can participate on your own. If collaborating on a team, you MUST adhere to local COVID-19 protocols, wearing masks as prescribed. 😷 
 
Starts anytime after 00:00 on Friday, 1 April 2022, in your own time zone. Ends anytime before 23:59 on Monday, 4 April 2022, in your own time zone. 
 
Register officially at   anytime before 23:59 on Monday, 4 April 2022, in your own time zone. Every member of your team should register individually by submitting the form as well. 
 
See   for a summary of a past CS50x Puzzle Day, and see   for some past puzzles for practice. Indeed, the best way to practice for this year is to solve past puzzles first!

154,Running Times - SIGCSE 2021,"Searching an array of a values is a bit like checking what's behind door number 1 (or 0) followed by door number i, which sounds a bit like Let's Make a Deal. So why not approach it as such? We present an introduction to arrays, linear search, and binary search that typically involves inviting one or two students to the front of the class to search a pair of arrays, unordered and ordered. The array itself can be implemented with pieces of paper taped to the board, behind which are numbers in chalk, or as HTML divs on a touchscreen instead, or even as actual doors. Sometimes the demo goes well, with one search taking n steps and the other log n. Sometimes the students get lucky, and both take just 1! With a bit of planning or choreography, though, the intended points can be made. And quite often do students' classmates start rooting for them along the way.

155,Toward an Ungraded CS50 - SIGCSE 2021,"In 2010, we proposed to eliminate letter grades in CS50 at Harvard University in favor of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS), whereby students would instead receive at term's end a grade of SAT in lieu of A through C- or UNS in lieu of D+ through E. Albeit designed to empower students without prior background to explore an area beyond their comfort zone without fear of failure, that proposal initially failed. Not only were some concentrations on campus unwilling to grant credit for SAT, the university's program in general education (of which CS50 was part) required that all courses be taken for letter grades. In 2013, we instead proposed, this time successfully, to allow students to take CS50 either for a letter grade or SAT/UNS. And in 2017, we made SAT/UNS the course's default, though students could still opt out. The percentage of students taking the course SAT/UNS jumped that year to 31%, up from 9% in the year prior, with as many as 86 of the course's 671 students (13%) reporting that they enrolled because of SAT/UNS. The percentage of women in the course also increased to 44%, a 29-year high. And 19% of students who took the course SAT/UNS subsequently reported that their concentration would be or might be CS. Despite concerns to the contrary, students taking the course SAT/UNS reported spending not less but more time on the course each week than letter-graded classmates. And, once we accounted for prior background, they performed nearly the same. We present the challenges and results of this 10-year initiative. We argue ultimately in favor of SAT/UNS, provided students must still meet all expectations, including all work submitted, in order to be eligible for SAT.

*Besides practicing coding every day, what are other activities and exercises you do that indirectly or directly help you with programming tasks?
*How can I contribute to CS50?
*What do you recommend as best practice in taking notes?
How do you think this worldwide lockdown will change education? How will it affect CS50 and CS50x?
*Can you share the story behind the current CS50 video intro that is quite similar to that of The Crown?
*What is a good scope for the CS50 final project and is there somewhere to look at good examples of past final projects?
*How do we make practical use of our learning in CS50 and related courses if we aren’t working in that field? 
*Which CS50 forum is the best when office hours are unavailable? Also, how do you keep yourself motivated with a self-regulated class like CS50?

221,How an Emoji Becomes an Emoji,"A Zoom-based class about emojis for anyone online, with Jennifer 8. Lee and David J. Malan.

How exactly does an emoji end up on your phone keyboard? It's actually a tightly regulated process overseen by the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit organization based in Silicon Valley whose members are primarily multinational US tech companies. Jennifer 8. Lee '98-'99 is one of the founders of Emojination, a grassroots group whose motto is ""Emoji for the people, by the people."" This global network works to make the emoji approval process an inclusive and representative process. Among its accomplishments are HIJAB, DUMPLING, INTERRACIAL COUPLE, SARI, PINATA, as well as half of all emoji passed in the last years. Jenny is a vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee.

Jennifer 8. Lee '98-'99 is the co-founder of the literary studio Plympton, as well as a documentary film producer and a vice-chair of the Unicode emoji subcommittee. One of the youngest full reporters at The New York Times, where she worked for nearly a decade, Jenny is a producer of ""The Search for General Tso"" and ""Picture Character,"" both which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. She's the author of the New York Times-bestselling book, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles (Twelve, 2008), where she showed that fortune cookies were actually Japanese. She does work around misinformation and is a co-founder of Misinfocon and the Credibility Coalition. She has served on the boards for the Nieman Foundation, the Center for Public Integrity, the Digital Public Library of America, the Asian American Writers’ Workshop, Hacks/Hackers, as well as committees for the New York Public Library's Young Lions Fiction Award, the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards, and SXSW programming. Jenny, who is a Fast Company Most Creative Person in 2018, graduated from Harvard College with a degree in applied math and economics.

289,"An Open-Source, API-Based Framework for Assessing the Correctness of Code in CS50 - ITiSCE 2020","We present check50, an open-source, extensible tool for assessing the correctness of students' code that provides a simple, functional framework for writing checks as well as an easy-to-use API that abstracts away common tasks, among them compiling and running programs, providing their inputs, and checking their outputs. As a result, check50 has allowed us to provide students with immediate feedback on their progress as they complete an assignment while also facilitating automatic and consistent grading, allowing teaching staff to spend more time giving tailored, qualitative feedback. 

We have found, though, that since introducing check50 in 2012 in CS50 at Harvard, students have begun to perceive the course's programming assignments as more time-consuming and difficult than in years past. We speculate that the feedback that check50 provides prior to students' submission of each assignment has compelled students to spend more time debugging than they had in the past. At the same time, students' correctness scores are now higher than ever.

Just how private are your emails and texts? What's ""end-to-end encryption""? Is Zoom actually bad? And just what does incognito mode do? All this and more.

00:51:03 - Constraint Satisfaction
00:59:17 - Node Consistency
01:03:03 - Arc Consistency
01:16:53 - Backtracking Search

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course's end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course's end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

400,Introducing submit.cs50.io,"submit.cs50.io is CS50’s new tool for managing student submissions online. Though students technically submit their code to GitHub, students and teachers need not be familiar with Git itself to be able to take advantage of CS50’s submission system!

With submit.cs50.io, teachers are able to more easily create a course, invite students to join it, collect submissions for particular problems, view how students did on each assignment, and provide written feedback on students’ code.

submit.cs50.io handles all of the behind-the-scenes work: ensuring that teachers always have permission to view and comment on student submissions on GitHub, and keeping track of all students’ files and at what time they were submitted. 

We’ve also built into submit.cs50.io a number of ways to give teachers easy access to their students’ data; for example, submit.cs50.io allows teachers to export student submission data in a CSV spreadsheet that can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets. We also offer an API, so teachers who wish to write their own scripts for grading and course management can easily access and use their course data in whatever way best suits the needs of their classroom."

402,DNA - Nifty Assignments - SIGCSE 2020,"A ""nifty assignment"" by Brian Yu for the 51st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '20). Assignment at   #SIGCSE2020

""This assignment is a whodunit, a CSI-style problem for which students write a program to search a DNA database to find a match to a ""suspect"". This application of computer science to biology asks students to explore DNA profiling and how forensic investigators can identify to whom a given sequence of DNA belongs. Students learn about Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), short sequences of DNA that repeat consecutively at specific locations within a person's DNA. The number of times each STR repeats can be used to identify someone based on their DNA. Students compute the STRs from a target DNA sequence and compare to the database of STR counts to identify the person to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs. We use this assignment to introduce students to Python and to give students practice with loops, string manipulation, and file I/O."""
403,Teaching Academic Honesty in CS50 - SIGCSE 2020,"A talk for the 51st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '20). Paper at   Slides at   #SIGCSE2020

""We aspire to teach academic honesty in CS50 at Harvard University not only by addressing academic dishonesty when it occurs but by addressing it before it does. By way of communication, course- and campus-wide awareness of policy, just-in-time prompts, interventional conversations, and problem sets have we tried to preempt submission of plagiarized work. But few interventions have had significant or lasting effects on the number of instances thereof. Most impactful has been the addition of one sentence to the course's syllabus, a ""regret clause"" that encourages students to come forward within 72 hours of some dishonest act on their part, before the course itself is even aware. While we might zero the work in question in such cases, we commit to not escalating the matter further to the university's honor council, where the outcome might instead be admonishment, probation, or even required withdrawal from the university itself. We instead advise students on how best to move forward and connect them as needed with support structures on campus for academics and mental health. Since 2014 have 89 students invoked the clause, between 1% and 3% of the course's student body each year."""

In this episode, David and Brian discuss CS50's experience with matters of academic dishonesty, whereby students sometimes submit work that's not entirely their own. While the course aspires each year to reduce the number of instances thereof, most educationally impactful to date has been the course's introduction of a ""regret clause"" to its syllabus. If students do cross some ethical line, often late at night under significant stress, they are now encouraged to reach out to the course's heads within 72 hours. The course then addresses the matter internally, without escalation to the university itself. While the work in question is usually zeroed, students are often referred to other resources on campus as well for academic support and mental health. The effect has been to transform a process that was once primarily punitive into teachable moments.

430,"Education as a Service: Containerization and Orchestration of CS50 IDE, Cloud Native Revolution 2019","CS50 is Harvard University's introductory course in computer science, freely available as OpenCourseWare, with hundreds of students on campus each term and more than one million registrants online. So that students have a uniform environment with which to begin programming (without client-side technical difficulties in the way), the course provides CS50 IDE, a free, cloud-based solution. 

To minimize cost and avoid homegrown orchestration of VMs, the course transitioned to pods, one container per student. But the migration was not without challenges. How to provide users with ephemeral containers but persistent storage? How to proxy arbitrary ports to students' own web services? And, ultimately, how to provide students with the abstraction of their own machine, without k8s-specific implementation details clouding their own understanding thereof? In this talk, CS50's own solutions thereto."
431,"Memorial Hall Fire Historical Footage - September 6, 1956","""For almost 60 years, all students in the Yard had to do to get the time was glance north toward Memorial Hall's 200-foot-high clock tower. Then, on September 6, 1956, a worker involved in a project to restore the clock left his blowtorch on. The subsequent inferno raged for four hours and completely destroyed the tower, its clocks and its 3,000-pound bell....""

 

""The tower of Memorial Hall, truncated by fire on September 6, 1956, will finally boast a spire once again. Construction begins on site July 1, [1999,] and the building will be whole by year's end...""

 
432,"Emoji by the People, For the People, a CS50 tech talk by Jennifer 8. Lee","How exactly does an emoji end up on your phone keyboard? It’s actually a tightly regulated process overseen by the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit organization based in Silicon Valley whose members are primarily multinational US tech companies. Jennifer 8. Lee ‘98-‘99 is one of the founders of Emojination, a grassroots group whose motto is “Emoji for the people, by the people.” This global network works to make the emoji approval process an inclusive and representative process. Among its accomplishments are HIJAB, DUMPLING, INTERRACIAL COUPLE, SARI, PINATA, as well as half of all emoji passed in the last years. Jenny is a vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee."

01:26:540 - Net Neutrality
01:34:050 - A Net Neutrality Primer

This course is a variant of Harvard University's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed especially for lawyers (and law students). Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach, emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related thereto. Ultimately, it equips students with a deeper understanding of the legal implications of technological decisions made by clients.

Through a mix of technical instruction and discussion of case studies, this course empowers students to be informed contributors to technology-driven conversations. In addition, it prepares students to formulate technology-informed legal arguments and opinions. Along the way, it equips students with hands-on experience with Python and SQL, languages via which they can mine data for answers themselves.

Topics include algorithms, cloud computing, databases, networking, privacy, programming, scalability, security, and more, with a particular emphasis on understanding how the work developers do and the technological solutions they employ may impact clients. Students emerge from this course with first-hand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making.

This course is a variant of Harvard University's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed especially for lawyers (and law students). Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach, emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related thereto. Ultimately, it equips students with a deeper understanding of the legal implications of technological decisions made by clients.

Through a mix of technical instruction and discussion of case studies, this course empowers students to be informed contributors to technology-driven conversations. In addition, it prepares students to formulate technology-informed legal arguments and opinions. Along the way, it equips students with hands-on experience with Python and SQL, languages via which they can mine data for answers themselves.

Topics include algorithms, cloud computing, databases, networking, privacy, programming, scalability, security, and more, with a particular emphasis on understanding how the work developers do and the technological solutions they employ may impact clients. Students emerge from this course with first-hand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making.

499,CS50's own Zamyla Chan's Thesis Defense for her Ph.D. in Chemistry,"""Synthesis and in-situ characterization of metastable metal oxide polymorphs for oxygen evolution catalysis""

This is the final oral examination for CS50's own Zamyla Chan for a Ph.D. in Chemistry!

""The widespread implementation of solar energy at the level needed for global energy demand requires its efficient storage in the form of fuels. The conversion of water to H2 and O2 is one of the most energy dense carbon-neutral fuel schemes to store solar energy. Effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require a design that manages the coupling of electrons and protons so as to avoid high energy intermediates. Of these two proton-coupled electron transfer reactions, the OER is more kinetically challenging because it requires the management of four electrons and four protons. The development of superior metal oxide oxygen-evolving catalysts (OECs) requires a fundamental understanding of the ubiquitous factors influencing high performing catalysts. In this thesis, we investigate the synthesis of metal oxide polymorphs, particularly for oxygen evolution catalysis, and how a universal design criteria for optimal OECs may be applied across methods of synthesis."""

Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. By course's end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. By course's end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native, a popular open-source framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift. The course introduces students to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, students gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which students implement an app entirely of their own design.

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D interactive games. Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. By course's end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. By course's end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native, a popular open-source framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift. The course introduces students to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, students gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which students implement an app entirely of their own design.

This course is for students who don't (yet) consider themselves computer persons. Designed for students who work with technology every day but don't necessarily understand how it all works underneath the hood or how to solve problems when something goes wrong, this course fills in the gaps, empowering students to use and troubleshoot technology more effectively. Through lectures on hardware, the Internet, multimedia, security, programming, and web development as well as through readings on current events, this course equips students for today's technology and prepares them for tomorrow's as well.

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D interactive games. Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using the LÖVE framework and Lua programming language. By course's end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native, a popular open-source framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript without Java or Swift. The course introduces students to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, students gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which students implement an app entirely of their own design.

786,Falling in LÖVE with Lua,"While modern AAA game engines like Unity and Unreal can make 3D cutting-edge game development exceptionally easier, they may not always be the best tool for modern 2D game development or the greatest entry point for a newcomer to the field. Enter LÖVE 2D: a simple and clean 2D game development framework utilizing Lua as its scripting language. In this seminar, we'll be implementing the classic Super Mario Bros. and showcasing the flexibility of what it means to develop in a small, dynamic language. By learning Lua, we'll not only have a useful tool in the context of 2D game development and LÖVE 2D but also the knowledge that Lua is omnipresent in the gaming industry, a skill we may hope to leverage on most any future indie or AAA project. Let's fall in LÖVE!"

This course is a variant of Harvard College's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed especially for business professionals. Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach, emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related thereto. Ultimately this course empowers students to make technological decisions even if not technologists themselves. Topics include cloud computing, networking, privacy, scalability, security, and more, with an emphasis on web and mobile technologies. Students emerge from this course with firsthand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making. This course is designed for managers, product managers, founders, and decision-makers more generally.

This talk will cover the technical challenges and design considerations that go into creating AR experiences with the Hololens using Unity. I'll talk through my experiences in building the viral Hololens project in which I recreated Super Mario Bros as a life size first person experience.

Bio

Abhishek loves building things both physical and digital. He brings a fair amount of skills to the table - fabrication, programming (frontend and backend), circuit design, 3D modeling and printing, design, and even an undergrad degree in business. He also has previous experience founding and running three tech startups and is currently working on his fourth. He also has multiple web apps currently out in the wild, a shoe that you control and customize through your phone, a lifesize dragon that you sit on to control a virtual dragon in a VR experience, a robotic desktop assistant that responds to voice commands in gifs and an interactive installation that went up in Times Square among other things.

You're welcome to participate in CS50x Coding Contest 2017 alone, but you'll still need to create a team (with just you on it).

4) Visit   to sign up for the contest itself, which officially begins on Friday, 13 January 2017, in all time zones! You're welcome to spend as much time on the contest as you'd like, so long as you finish by Sunday, 15 January 2017, in your own time zone. All challenges must be solved in C! 

Prizes will be awarded pseudorandomly to (a few) teams who answer the most questions correctly.

If you'd like to familiarize yourself with HackerRank's interface before CS50x Coding Contest 2016 begins, sign up for some practice challenges at   No need to create a team to practice.

1088,"Hello, Phandeeyar","Hello, world. And hello to everyone at Phandeeyar. My name is David Malan, and I teach CS50 at Harvard University. I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person today but just wanted to welcome you from afar to today's info session and to CS50 itself. Whether or not you have prior programming experience, the course is very much designed for students less comfortable and more comfortable alike. Indeed, at Harvard, 72% of the students who take CS50 have never taken a computer science course before. Indeed, most important is the community that you'll have there around you, with everyone in this together. 

Hope to meet you in person before long! Can't wait to hear how it goes. In the meantime, this is CS50."

CEO, TransitScreen

Cambridge isn’t just home to a hundred thousand smart people — it’s home to hundreds of thousands of smart sensors. From mobile phones to GPS trackers, electricity meters, cameras, microphones, and other “internet of things” devices, how does all this real-time data find its way to solutions for urban problems, as well as commercial opportunities? What other sources of non-real-time data (including maps) are available? What software and tools are available for turning “smart cities data” into information and ultimately action?"

CS50x CODING CONTEST 2017
an epic weekend of code

Open to CS50x students around the world (and friends). Solve as many problems (in C!) as you can!

HOW TO PARTICIPATE

1) Sign up for a (free) HackerRank account at  

2) Register yourself with CS50 for CS50x Coding Contest 2017 at  

3) Form a team with 0, 1, 2, or 3 classmates (or friends). At least one team member should be taking or should have taken CS50x. Either you or one of your teammates should then create your team at   selecting ""CS50x Coding Contest 2017"" where prompted, and add everyone else to the team. You're welcome to participate in CS50x Coding Contest 2017 alone, but you'll still need to create a team (with just you on it).

4) Visit   to sign up for the contest itself, which officially begins on Friday, 13 January 2017, in all time zones! You're welcome to spend as much time on the contest as you'd like, so long as you finish by Sunday, 15 January 2017, in your own time zone. All challenges must be solved in C! 

Prizes will be awarded pseudorandomly to (a few) teams who answer the most questions correctly.

If you'd like to familiarize yourself with HackerRank's interface before CS50x Coding Contest 2016 begins, sign up for some practice challenges at   No need to create a team to practice.

1185,Writing 2D Games in C using SDL by Thomas Lively,"SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer, is the cross-platform game library used in everything from small indie games to Valve’s blockbuster triple-A games to other applications with rich media needs. This seminar will teach you how to use this powerful C library to write your own 2D games. We will talk about the structure of game code and cover the installation and initialization of the SDL library, the creation and management of the game window, how to draw images onto the window, and how to handle keyboard and mouse input. By the end of the seminar you will have created a small demo that you can later build on as much as you want."
1186,Web Scraping with Nokogirl/Kimono by Robert Krabek,"There’s a lot of data out there on the internet that you might be interested in collecting but if you don’t want to manually copy it and there are no Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available for that data, then you might need to scrape that information. Web scraping, helps collect that data by parsing the HTML of a web page and extracting the information you want. We’ll go over the basics of how to use Nokogiri, a web scraping library in Ruby, and Kimono, a chrome extension with basic web scraping capabilities, to extract the data you need from the HTML of a website and output it into spreadsheet."
1187,Web Apps of the Future with React by Neel Mehta,"Forget PHP—React, developed by Facebook, is the future of web app development. It’s a powerful, easy to understand framework that lets you build entire web apps with nothing but JavaScript. There’s a reason it’s exploding in popularity and being adopted by apps like Instagram and Khan Academy—give it a try here."
1188,The Internet of Things by James Whittaker of Microsoft,"Change is coming. The web is being consumed by apps. Search is becoming a victim of its own success. The Internet of things is upon us and in the distance quantum computing is clouding the horizon. These changes will mean a shift of wealth. New winners, new losers. New monetization methods. New uses of data and machine intelligence. Where will it take us? Where will this all end? Join Microsoft Distinguished Engineer James Whittaker for a presentation that begins 20 years in the past and ends 20 years in the future with insight into how society will work, if machines will take over and what’s left for humanity if they do."
1189,Ruby on Rails by Leila Hofer,"Ruby on rails is an open source web development framework that is one of the most popular frameworks on the web. Rails has a lot to offer, but this seminar will focus on an introduction to rails and how to get a functional website up and running. It will review Model View Controller (MVC – you’ll be learning about this soon!) architecture and how to implement a basic MVC in Rails."
1190,Responsive Design with Bootstrap by Neel Mehta,"More people now visit the internet from mobile devices than desktops, but too many websites are built only with desktops in mind and look awful on mobile. Learn how to make your website look awesome on screens from tiny iPhones to giant iMacs using Bootstrap, the world’s most popular frontend web development framework."
1191,Python Web Apps with Flask by Ezra Zigmond,"Web frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails are great for building large, production applications, but sometimes you want something simpler. Flask is a small, easy to use framework for creating web apps in Python. This seminar will demonstrate creating a small application using Flask along with peewee, a Python library that makes it simple to work with SQL databases."
1192,iOS App Development with Swift by Dan Armendariz,"An introduction to iOS programming using Swift, Apple’s new programming language for Macs and iOS devices. We will cover the basics of the language, using APIs in your app, and deploying your app to an iOS device. Development requires a recent Mac with OS X 10.10.5 or later and, optional (but recommended), a device running a modern version of iOS."
1193,Fun with Music and Programming by Connor Harris and Stephen Krewson,"Students who want to do final projects involving music have a wealth of free, open-source resources available to them but may not know where to look. This seminar will serve as a quick introduction to libraries and programs for several common tasks, including sound processing and analysis, MIDI synthesis, and music-score typesetting. The seminar will focus especially on Euterpea, a library in the Haskell programming language for algorithmic composition and MIDI synthesis; and on Lilypond, a LaTeX-like declarative language. No prior knowledge of Haskell is assumed; elementary concepts will be covered as necessary."
1194,From C to Python by Ross Rheingans-Yoo,"Python is a popular language for everything from short, informal scripts to complex data-processing frameworks. Fortunately, the syntax is very similar to C, with just a few key differences. In this seminar, we’ll walk you through them, leaving you with the ability to write your own short (or long!) programs in Python, doing everything you already know how to do in C, only with fewer compilation errors!"
1195,Exploring JavaScript and the Web Audio API by Sam Green and Hugh Zabriskie,"The Web Audio API is high-level, powerful versatile system for controlling audio in web applications and is built in to most modern browsers. Originally designed for online gaming, this JavaScript API has been used to support a multitude of music-oriented applications, including online synthesizers, drum machines, guitar tuners, and collaborative music-making tools. The seminar will go over the major components of the API and then dive into some code for a basic sequencer."
1196,Customizing Cloud9 and the CS50 IDE by Dan Armendariz,"The CS50 IDE is used by all students in CS50 and is easily customizable using the Cloud9 plugin system. In this seminar, we introduce the plugin system that is at the core of Cloud9; written in Javascript with NodeJS and the Cloud9 SDK, plugins allow modification to just about every aspect of the IDE. We will briefly discuss the architecture of Cloud9 that enables the plugin system to work, walk through sample plugin code to create menu items, dialog windows, and communicate with the underlying Ubuntu instance, and show some examples of the plugins created by CS50 staff for the IDE."
1197,Awesome iPhone Apps with Objective-C by Zack Chauvin,"Learn the basics of Objective-C and Xcode to get started with app development for iPhone. In this tutorial, you’ll become familiar with the IDE used for iOS, the basic structure of an iPhone application, and some tips and tricks for jumping into development."

It is an open-source containerization engine which allows developers to package up an application in a container along with all the settings and software required to run it, and deploy with a minimum of fuss. Tens of thousands of developers currently use Docker for their development, testing, and deployment workflows. This session will introduce the Docker ecosystem, how it works, and how to build, share, and deploy Docker containers."

CS50x PUZZLE DAY 2016
2 DAYS OF PUZZLES AND PRIZES

Open to CS50x students around the world (and friends). Team of size 2, 3, or 4 encouraged but not required.

Register at   Invite friends. Visit   if looking for teammates.

HOW IT WORKS

* On Friday, 12 February 2016 (in your own time zone), your team will download a packet of puzzles (written by our friends at Facebook)! We'll email you a link by 00:00 that morning!
* Your team will then have until the end of Saturday, 13 February 2016 (in your own time zone), to solve as many puzzles as you can. You'll submit your answers online.
* Your team is welcome to work on the puzzles online or in person (by yourselves or alongside other teams).
* After Saturday, 13 February 2016, we'll post a walkthrough video in which we explain the (correct!) answers.
* Prizes will be awarded pseudorandomly to (a few) teams who answer the most questions correctly.
* All teams will be featured on a Big Board that announces how many puzzles each team got right (unless you opt out).
* Puzzles will not require prior programming experience, just logic and smarts. All you'll need is a computer with Internet access, a pen or pencil, and scratch paper.

WANT TO HOST?

If you'd like to host CS50x Puzzle Day 2016 in your area, whereby you'd coordinate a time and place for your team and others to gather, let us know at

With time the database technologies have evolved. In this session, we will talk about the evolution of databases from SQL to NoSQL and understand how the NoSQL paradigm is making a big difference in powering modern-day use-cases. We will also take a close look at DynamoDB, Amazon’s primary NoSQL database. We will go over the high level concepts and design patterns with DynamoDB, and focus on how you can build interesting applications for Mobile, Gaming, IoT etc. using DynamoDB. This Tech Talk will use AWS and online materials contained in the AWS Educate portal. To access the materials and get free credits to use AWS for your CS50 projects and more, signup in advance for a student membership at www.awseducate.com."

1488,Essential Scale-Out Computing by James Cuff,"Each day you interact with thousands upon thousands of processors, servers, storage systems and high-speed networks. You don't see them, and you don't physically touch them, but they are there, making everything happen behind the scenes. Everything is powered by advanced computing, from your morning news, movie and video streams, phone conversations, currency, financial markets, pharmaceuticals, navigation, traffic, weather, email and of course all of our social media updates. Each of us consumes vast amounts of data and computation on a daily basis. We also continue to push the boundaries of our science and discovery. Using ever more complex computer models to peer into the darkness of space or to understanding the genetic basis as to why were are human. All of this needs computing for it to work correctly, and it also needs advanced infrastructure and distributed computing architectures to work quickly. James Cuff is the Assistant Dean for Research Computing here at Harvard. His group runs more than sixty thousand high performance computing processors and more than fourteen petabytes of storage for science. On a global scale, this system is tiny. However, he will show you real world examples of the advances in computation science, physical infrastructure and distributed computing systems we are using each day, whether you are a particle physicist trying to reverse engineer the very fabric of the universe – or maybe you are just updating your selfie... So what will you learn from this seminar? You are all designing software for your final project. Facebook for example, was originally designed as a small single server PHP application. In order to make it scale to today’s hundreds of thousands of servers and billions of users took years. James will explain how both datacenter and systems architectures that now surpass electrical power usage of 10-20 megawatts – (enough to power more than 20,000 houses, nearly half of the City of Cambridge) enable today’s applications to scale. Each computation, be it add, subtract, multiply, divide, strcmp(), grep or memory hash lookup you make in your application now matters. You will be shown not only how distributed computing factors into your applications, but also how the actual energy efficiency of your algorithms matters. Designing, and thinking about how your application will scale from the beginning to potentially manage 10,000’s of page impressions a second is now the new normal."

LYRICS

This one is for the boys with the operating systems
Linux, Mac OS, and the Windows system
When he come up on the stage, we be raving up
Pops stacks on deck like he saving up

And he ill, he real, he got all the skill 
He lectures and he got that sex appeal
He codes, we enroll, it might not load
He might send texts to the whole entire world

He writes motherf***ing scripts scripts sailor of the ship ship 
When he makes a zip zip download all that s*** s***
That's the kinda dude I was looking for
And yes you'll get hacked if you're looking ho

I said, excuse me you're a hell of a guy,
I mean m m my my you're like shuttle bus fly
You're so shy and I'm loving comp sci
You're like slicker than Rob Bowden with those damn sexy eyes

Oh yes we did yes we did
Somebody please tell em who the eff we is
We are Corinne and Kat
We back files up, set make files up, and run compilers up

Boy you got my segfaults running away,

This one is for the TFs and the gradeers
Entrepreneur coders got no haters
He can debug with the crew or do it later
But I think I like it better when it's beta
And I think I like him better with the gcc on
He aint even gotta try to turn his Mac on
He just gotta gimme that pset when he gimme that pset then the panties coming off off uh

Excuse me you're a hell of a guy,
I mean I really gotta thing for W3School guys
Sigh, 12345, I can that you're in touch with your cryptography side

Uh yes we did yes we did
Somebody please tell em who the eff we is

In this seminar we'll put up a website that's not yet, ahem, ready, and split the attendees into two teams. Team one's job: exploit all the vulnerabilities in the code; team two's job: patch them up before team one gets there. We'll be guiding the challenge by exposing the different mistakes that become security problems, how to spot them quickly, and how to patch them up correctly."
