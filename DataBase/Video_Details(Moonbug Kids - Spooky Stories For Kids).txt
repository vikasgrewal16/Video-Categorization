I love to go to school
Sing and dance with lots of laughs
I love to go to school
Back to school, back to school

What will I learn? What will I play?
Back to school today!
I can sing my ABCs
I love to go to school
I can count to one, two, three
I love to go to school
We can play with all our friends
We love to go to school
It feels like fun will never end
We love to go to school
Back to school, back to school

Weasel is driving Max with some modifications, his new turbo charged engine, whilst Gecko drives Tilly, relying on his reliable old tow truck instead of any wacky mods. They prepare for a drag race. However, predictably, it does wrong. Weasel goes really fast at first, but then loses control and crashes into a muddy pond. Gecko and Tilly win, but then double back to rescue Max and Weasel as they sink into the mud, pulling them to safety - Gecko has to unscrew Max's new ridiculous engine as it's so heavy it's making them sink! Gecko then gets a medal, and Weasel has to admit that, at least this time, Gecko won fair and square.

Lyrics:
Let’s go for a nature walk
Listen to the birdies talk
Go strolling in the grass
While clouds go rolling past

Short and leafy forest trees  
Tall and pointy forest trees 
Forest trees stand happily 
As we’re whistling

Red and orange autumn leaves
Green and yellow autumn leaves
Autumn leaves dance in the breeze
As we’re whistling
 
Sweet and tiny flowers bloom
Big and happy flowers bloom
Can you smell their sweet perfume

As we’re whistling

Flapping, chirping birds go by
Swimming, quacking ducks go by
Floating free and flying high
As we’re whistling

We went for a nature walk
Listened to the birdies talk
Went strolling in the grass
While clouds went rolling past

I can't sleep I had a bad dream

Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Look around, what can you see?
Hold your cuddle buddy tight
Cuddles help you sleep tonight

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Watch the night light glowing bright
Light will help you sleep tonight

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep

40,The Tortoise and the Hare - @Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes  Kids Song | Classic Fable,"Who’s going to win the race, the speedy hare, or the slow tortoise? Have fun singing along with this classic story!

Lyrics:
Once there was a very very speedy hare
Once there was a very very speedy hare
He would brag from near and far 
That he was faster than a car
Oh yes, one time there was a very speedy hare

The plucky tortoise said to Hare, “Let’s have a race,”
The plucky tortoise said to Hare, “Let’s have a race,”
“If you’re so fast in running shoes,
Then there’s no way that you can lose,”
Oh yes, the tortoise said to Hare “Let’s have a race”

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let’s watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

All the animals came down to see them run
All the animals came down to see them run
With a bell the race began
And fast away the quick hare ran
Oh yes, the animals came down to see them run

The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
Since the hare so quickly sped,
He had by now run far ahead
Oh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let’s watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
Since he thought he couldn’t lose,
He laid right down to take a snooze
Oh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win

The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
He passed by the sleeping hare,
Who kept on snoring, unaware
Oh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let’s watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
The sleepy hare woke up and ran
As fast as speedy quick hares can
Oh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line

Yes it’s true that slow and steady wins the race
Yes it’s true that slow and steady wins the race
Oh yes the hare was very fast
But even so, he came in last
Oh yes it’s true that slow and steady wins the race

The sand and sea’s the place to be

Let’s build, build, build a castle
Build, build, build a castle
Let’s build, build, build a castle
We’re playing at the beach

Let’s splash, splash, splash in the waves
Splash, splash, splash in the waves
Let’s splash, splash, splash in the waves
We’re playing at the beach

Let’s bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
Bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
Let’s bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
We’re playing at the beach

Let’s fly, fly, fly a kite
Fly, fly, fly a kite
Let’s fly, fly, fly a kite
We’re playing at the beach

53,Rocket Powered Ice Cream Truck - @Gecko's Garage - Trucks For Children | Trick or Treat,"Vicky Ice Cream Truck knocks her ice cream ornament on a low bridge, and so goes to Weasel's Wheels to get it fixed. However, lazy ol' Weasel just grabs the nearest cone-shaped object (which happens to be a rocket) and sticks that on her roof. Of course, she then speeds off out of control. She passes Gecko, who is with the mechanicals at the side of the road. He yells through his new megaphone and tells Vicky to go round the roundabout continuously until he can work out a way to stop her. Vicky does this - Gecko and the mechs try a few ways to stop her and finally they're able to put the rocket out by throwing a bucket of water over it - Vicky is dizzy but fine. Gecko then fashions his megaphone into a proper replacement ornament for Vicky.

Lyrics: 

I’ve got a bottle, where does it go?
It’s made of plastic, where does it go?
I’ve got a bottle, where does it go?
Let’s sort out all the trash!
HMMMMM...

The plastic goes in the plastic bin

Let’s sort out all the  trash!

I’ve got a box, oh, where does it go?
It’s made of cardboard, where does it go?
I’ve got a box, oh, where does it go?
Let’s sort out all the trash!
HMMMMM...

The cardboard goes in the cardboard bin
The cardboard goes in the cardboard bin
The cardboard goes in the cardboard bin

I’ve got a can, oh, where does it go?
It’s made of metal, where does it go?

Let’s sort out all the trash!
HMMMMM...

The metal goes in the metal bin
The metal goes in the metal bin
The metal goes in the metal bin

I’ve got a jar, oh, where does it go?
It’s made of glass, so where does it go?

Let’s sort out all the trash!
HMMMMM...

The glass things go in the glass bin
The glass things go in the glass bin

Let’s sort out all the trash!

I’ve got an apple core, where does it go?
It’s leftover food, so where does it go?

72,No Monsters - Halloween - @Gecko's Garage - Trucks For Children | Halloween For Kids,"It's a spooky full moon night. Max the Monster Truck is getting over-excited by all the Halloween decorations and is driving around. However, he crashes into a creepy sign and then a picket fence, and comes out with fangs and horns, then goes through a bush and gets covered in leaves that look like scales - he looks like a real monster. At the garage, Gecko and the mechs are in costume and they're decorating Tilly. Gecko asks Green to go outside to turn the Halloween lights on, but as she goes she sees what she THINKS is a monster (Max). She gets Red to take a look, who is very doubtful, but then he sees it too and runs in terror to Gecko! Gecko assures them there's no such thing as monsters, but when they insist he takes a look. He too is spooked at first at the sight of Max, but then sees who it is and realises Max needs a bit of help getting cleaned up. So they take him to the carwash to clean him up. All except the teeth - he keeps those for his actual Halloween costume.

Gecko leaps in to help, but The Mechs get sucked up too, and he loses all the metal spanner he tries to use to switch it off - Gecko is even dragged along by his dungaree buckles! However, Gecko uses his smarts, ditching his dungos and using a 'wooden spanner' improvised from a wooden spoon to unscrew the lever and turn the magnet off, saving the day.

Oh no we just have one!

I want the color blue
Oh no we just have one!

Everyone has more fun!

It’s better to work together
Because it’s double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun

Today’s our day to play 
Out here in the sun  
Riding on the tricycle...
When we work together 
Everyone has more fun!

Lyrics:
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
‘Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

See the blazing Yule before us
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
While I tell of Yuletide treasure
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Fast away the old year passes
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Hail the new year, lads and lasses
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Sing we joyous, all together
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Heedless of the wind and weather
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
‘Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Lyrics:
When it’s dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Looky-look! a little snail
Crawling on the ground
Looky-look!  a bunny hops
Bouncing up and down

Looky-look! a silly goose
Eats berries one by one
Looky-look!  a hairy moose
The berries are all gone

With our thumbs and fingers too
We’ll make a shadow puppet zoo!

Looky-look! A happy cow
Listen to her moo
Looky-look! a big gray wolf
Howling at the moon

Looky-look! An elephant!
His trunk sways to and fro
Looky-look! A Spooky Spider!
A Spider!? Yikes! Let’s Go!

When it’s dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Out came the family  
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie was scared as could be
Cheep Cheep! She called out for her family
Out came the kids
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?
    
The itsy bitsy birdie was wrapped up safe and sound
Cheep! Called her mama seeing she’d been found
Out came the ladder
To help their birdie friend 
How will  itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie looked up at the tree
Up Up! Went daddy, brave as can be
Out came Mama bird
To see her baby’s friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie’s
Nearly home again!      

The itsy bitsy birdie was safely tucked away
Hooray! Cried the family, and helped her on her way
Out came the rope
To help their birdie friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie
Was safe at home again!

The big brave daddy turned to leave
Clatter! Went the ladder, where his feet should be 
Out came a, YIKES
Can you guess what happened then?

The big, brave daddy
Was safe at home again!

Lyrics:
FIVE little monsters jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head;
Mother called the doctor
And the doctor said:
No more jumping on the bed.

FOUR little monsters jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head;
Mother called the doctor
And the doctor said:
No more jumping on the bed.

THREE little monsters jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head;
Mother called the doctor
And the doctor said:
No more jumping on the bed.

TWO little monsters jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped her head;
Mother called the doctor
And the doctor said:
No more jumping on the bed.

ONE little monster jumping on the bed
*He* fell off and bumped his head;
Mother called the doctor
And the doctor said:
No more jumping on the bed!

Hey You! ....Boo!

There are no monsters who live in our home
There's only me - and my family
Who live in our home, cos
There are no monsters that live here!

There are no monsters who live in our home
There's only me - and my family
Who live in our home, cos
There are no monsters that live here!


Hey You! ....Boo!
Did you *see* that there?
Is it a monster standing over there?

There are no monsters who live in our home
There's only me - and my family
Who live in our home, cos
There are no monsters that live here!


Hey You! ....Boo!

Lyrics:

Buster eats his ice-cream, he wants more
But oh no! His tooth is sore
Robin thinks the dentist is the place to go
But Buster is frightened, he just won’t go

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don’t forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Buster isn’t happy when he goes to eat
He doesn’t want to try a healthier treat
Robin! You need to help your friend
He wants to see that Buster will be on the mend

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don’t forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Amber’s here to help, it’s such a relief
She shows him how to take care of his teeth

That eating healthy is a lovely idea
And going to the dentist isn’t something to fear

And to keep your smile so shiny and white
Brush your teeth with toothpaste morning and night

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don’t forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

munch, munch, munch
munch, munch, munch
The monster from the bus goes munch, munch, munch
And eats the fruit away
 
The people on the bus all clap and sing
clap and sing
clap and sing

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a zombie I see over there?
Oh no! It’s coming our way!
Let’s all run out the room
Phew!
It's only Daddy in costume

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a ghost hiding under the stairs?
Take a closer look and follow me
I can see little feet
Phew!
It’s Alien under bed sheets

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 
 
Is that a vampire creeping up on us ?
It looks like it’s heading this way
I can see a big cape 
Phew!
It’s mummy tricking us again

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

There were bumps and jumps and spooky scares
And the monsters danced the day away
But they were all just pretend
Phew!
Halloween’s great with our friends.

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a zombie I see over there?
Oh no! It’s coming our way!
Let’s all run out the room
Phew!
It's only Daddy in costume

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a ghost hiding under the stairs?
Take a closer look and follow me
I can see little feet
Phew!
It’s Alien under bed sheets

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 
 
Is that a vampire creeping up on us ?
It looks like it’s heading this way
I can see a big cape 
Phew!
It’s mummy tricking us again

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

There were bumps and jumps and spooky scares
And the monsters danced the day away
But they were all just pretend
Phew!
Halloween’s great with our friends.

He doesn’t understand why all his friends are frightened of him and won’t play, until his best friend Scout takes him to the carwash to clean all the slime off.

Buster giggles, he can’t see

When you’re splashed with Zombie slime!

He gives Digger such a fright!

She’s so scared, she runs away!
Halloween’s a spooky time
When you’re splashed with Zombie slime!
----------
Buster’s sad, he wants to play
All his friends just hide away
Halloween’s a spooky time
When you’re splashed with Zombie slime!

----------
Oh, my goodness, what a sight
Buster gives himself a fright!
Halloween’s a spooky time
When you’re splashed with Zombie slime!
--------
Scout has had a great idea
There’s a local car wash near
Halloween’s a spooky time
When you’re splashed with Zombie slime!

Once you’re free from Zombie slime!

When you hear the song do the monster dance,
Everybody do the monster dance,
Bend your knees and turn around,
Dancing to that monster sound!

Clap your hands
For our favorite holiday
It's Halloween

Lyric:
Dress up , dress up yippee yay
Let’s pretend and let’s all play
Let’s be who we want to be
Dress up time come play with me

I can wear a pirate hat
Fix my eye patch just like that  
Stompy boots, and a parrot mate
[I'm a pirate!] I look great

Dress up , dress up yippee yay
Let’s pretend and let’s all play
Let’s be who we want to be

I can wear a magic gown
I can wear a golden crown
Shiny jewels that match my dress
[Look at Me!] I’m a princess

Dress up , dress up yippee yay
Let’s pretend and let’s all play
Let’s be who we want to be
Dress up time come play with me

I can wear an airplane suit
And a hat that looks so cute

278,What is a Jack O' Lantern? - Halloween Pumpkin - Twinkle | Spooky Halloween Stories For Kids,"Learn to carve pumpkins and Jack O' Lanterns with Twinkle the Little Star in this Spooky Halloween song!

Meet Twinkle! She is a fun, playful and energetic Star. She is very inquisitive and loves to play and learn new things!

Halloween is here today 
Here today, here today 
Twinkle and her friends all play  
In Halloween costumes! 
What is that that’s big and round 
big and round, big and round? 
What’s that orange thing they’ve found 
And what does it do? 
Maybe it’s a thing you bop 
thing you bop, thing you bop 
It rolls around and then it stops 
What could it be for? 
Maybe it’s a thing to eat 
thing to eat, thing to eat 
Bear tries some - is it a treat? 
Bear isn’t sure… 
Who can help them work it out 
Work it out, work it out 
Owl flies down to the ground 
On Halloween night 
A lantern with a smiley face 
A smiley face, smiley face 
A pumpkin that lights up the place 
With a candle that’s bright! 
You can make a pumpkin too 
pumpkin too pumpkin too 
On Halloween it’s what we do 
To decorate our home 
The night is coming to an end 
To an end to an end 
Twinkle had fun with her friends 
But now it’s time to go.. 
Happy Halloween!

Who’s that knocking
At the door?
Three little kittens
And one more makes four!
What would they like
A trick or treat
Give them a smile
And a sweet to eat!

Halloween, Halloween,
Let’s have fun,
Halloween, Halloween,
Fun for everyone.

Grab mommies hand,
It’s your turn now,
Show her a twirl,
And take a bow.

Vacuum is eating Emma, Debbie is locked up in the fridge and Bob is kidnapped by the iron. Arpo! Stop the appliances and save the family!

ARPO isn't some top secret government's project, he is a harmless housekeeper; one who unfortunately finds himself working for the wackiest family known to mankind. His job is to look after the impossibly absent-minded adults, clean up after the meddling nine-year-old boy and most of all, survive BABY DANIEL - a little trouble magnet.

The best thing is trick or treat!

Go house to house, along the street,

Lots of fun for everyone,
You could be a princess too,
Costume fun for me and you!

People in costumes,
Halloween’s here!
Don’t be frightened,
It’s not scary,
Look - a pirate!
And a fairy!

Halloween, Halloween,
Let’s have fun,
Halloween, Halloween,
Fun for everyone

Who’s that knocking
At the door?
Three little kittens
And one more makes four!
What would they like
A trick or treat
Give them a smile
And a sweet to eat!

Halloween, Halloween,
Let’s have fun,
Halloween, Halloween,
Fun for everyone.

Grab mommies hand,
It’s your turn now,
Show her a twirl,
And take a bow.
Your costumes on,
You’re on your feet,
Knock! Knock! Knock!

386,No No Spooky Monsters Song | Little Baby Bum | Kids Songs | Spooky Halloween Stories For Kids,"Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a zombie I see over there?
Oh no! It’s coming our way!
Let’s all run out the room
Phew!
It's only Daddy in costume

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

Is that a ghost hiding under the stairs?
Take a closer look and follow me
I can see little feet
Phew!
It’s Alien under bed sheets

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 
 
Is that a vampire creeping up on us ?
It looks like it’s heading this way
I can see a big cape 
Phew!
It’s mummy tricking us again

Hey you, Boo! 
Did you hear that sound?
Is it a monster that i’ve found? 

There were bumps and jumps and spooky scares
And the monsters danced the day away
But they were all just pretend
Phew!
Halloween’s great with our friends.
