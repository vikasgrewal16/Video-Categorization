In mechanics, we deal with different types of materials, based on which we classify mechanics into three broad categories –
•        Engineering Mechanics
•        Solid Mechanics
•        Fluid Mechanics

In this video, we will discuss the latter two, i.e.,
        SOLID MECHANICS: Here we deal with deformable materials, which deform upon application of force, and resist the deformation with some resisting force. The resisting force per unit area (stress, σ) and fractional deformation in the material (strain, ϵ) are related by Hooke’s Law as,
σ=Eϵ
        FLUID MECHANICS: Here in our scope, we deal with ideal plastic materials, which we call ideal fluids. They deform upon application of force and cannot bear shear stresses. We study laws like Archimedes' Law, Pascal’s Law, etc. in this chapter.

We will be covering previous year's questions from these important chapters of Chemistry for JEE Advanced –
•        STRAIGHT LINES:
A straight line can be defined as a curve whose slope remains constant throughout the curve. In simple terms, it can be called to be a line that has no curves and extends to infinity on both sides.
The general equation of a straight line can be given by,
ax+by+c=0
•        CIRCLES:
A circle can be defined as the locus of a point that moves in a plane such that its distance from a fixed point in the plane, is always constant.
The general equation of a circle can be given by,
x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0

We will be covering previous year's questions from these important chapters of Chemistry for JEE Advanced –

•        THERMODYNAMICS:
In thermodynamics, we deal with the change of a system’s state from one state to another. The different types of thermodynamic processes are –
-        Isothermal: In this process, the temperature of the system remains constant.
-        Adiabatic: In this process, there is no exchange of heat between the system and the surroundings.
-        Isobaric: In this process, the pressure inside the system remains constant.
-        Isochoric: In this process, the volume of the system remains constant.

•        CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM:
A system is said to be in chemical equilibrium when the rate of change of concentration of the reactant is equal to the rate of change of concentration of the product. Hence, as a layman observer, it would appear that the reaction is completed, but actually, chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process, which appears to be static, but is not.

•        IONIC EQUILIBRIUM:
As in chemical equilibrium we talk about the equilibrium of compounds, here we also talk about the equilibrium of ions with their polar compounds. There are two types of substances –
-        Electrolytes: They dissociate into their constituent ions in an aqueous solution or molten state.
-        Non-electrolyte: They do not dissociate into their constituent ions in an aqueous solution or molten state.

my own as he couldn’t join coaching due to his 
financial condition.My college wasn’t that supportive
 in terms of JEE Preparation. So I had almost no knowledge 
about how to prepare for JEE. I had bought just a single book 
and I was confused while solving it too. After my 12th boards
 a friend of mine recommended PhysicsWallah. So, I bought a mobile
 phone and started learning online. My actual preparation started 
after my board exams,but I was lagging behind, so I studied
almost 15-17 hrs a day to cope up with the syllabus.

I first got to know about Alakh, sir, in 2018 when I was struggling to understand physics at my coaching institute, where my faculty only gave us reference books and told us to study on our own then a friend of mine introduced me to the videos of Alakh, sir, and presently my entire class follows him for physics and chemistry. I am a part of the Alakh sir’s team since when there was a lot of struggle in his life. I managed JEE and NIT Together only because of Physics Wallah, it is not easy but the classes at physics wallah are working as a stress-buster in this competitive era, hence now for me, Physics Wallah is no longer an institute its an emotion..!!
