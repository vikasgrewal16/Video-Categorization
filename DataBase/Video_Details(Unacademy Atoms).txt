Enroll Now for Unacademy Combat:  

So we should always be the thermostat, not the thermometer. Why? Because anyone can tell you the temperature. When there’s a problem, everyone can see there’s a problem. When times are busy, everyone can see that it is busy. If we act like thermometers and reflect our surroundings, we end up changing as often as British weather changes – which is a lot! When things go well, we are a vision of calm but when things start heating up, we lose our cool too. Rather than be influenced by life’s temperature – we should be what influences it!

While this sounds like the plot of a sci-fi film, it's an idea scientists came up with in response to a competition run by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For astronauts to live at a long-term base camp on Mars, they will need to find the energy to survive.

Scientists at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands think using a massive kite flown by robots, to harness high Martian wind speeds, could provide enough energy to sustain several astronauts in their everyday work.

Coulomb’s law was published by the French physicist, Charles Augustin de Coulomb. Coulomb’s law was critical in the development of the theory of electromagnetism. Moreover, our world is in existence only because of the forces of attraction and repulsion. The particles in the universe, as well as our environment, remain in a balanced form only because of the forces of attraction; this renders one of the practical applications of Coulomb’s law.  But did Coulomb really derived the law?, Find out from Manish Purohit Sir.

1985,Unacademy | The Greatest Lesson,"Watch the full film here -  

The sound of success is strung with notes. 
Notes of despair. 
Of grit and rigour. 
Of the pit of fire. 
Fueled by dreams and passion. 
Of the journey that shakes confidence. 
Of the journey that shapes character. 
The sound of success is loud. 
But the silence of hard work and perseverance speaks louder. 
So, rekindle the dreams, 
Rebuild the path.
For those who crack it, seldom give up. 
They keep going amidst all odds, 
For passion is undefeatable.
