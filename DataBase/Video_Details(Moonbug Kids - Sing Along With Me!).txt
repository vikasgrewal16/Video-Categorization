Let‚Äôs have some fun
Let‚Äôs run, run, run
Red Light Green Light 3, 2, 1!
 
Run towards the finish line
Give it all you‚Äôve got
But if you hear ‚ÄúRed Light!‚Äù
Stop, Stop, Stop
Look, you ran and tripped
So, you‚Äôre Out, Out, Out
But you can cheer along, 
When you hear me shout:
Green! 

Everybody come and play 
Who will win the game today?
Stop on red and go on green
Red Light, Green Light 123
Red!
 
None of you are moving
So, none of you are out
Everyone can run
When you hear me shout
Green! 
 
Everybody come and play 
Who will win the game today?
Stop on red and go on green
Red Light, Green Light 123
Red!

I can see you wobble
So, that means that you‚Äôre out!
The rest of you can run
When you hear me shout
Green!
 
Everybody come and play 
Who will win the game today?
Stop on red and go on green
Red Light, Green Light 123
Red!

Oh, your legs are kicking
So, that means you‚Äôre out
Who will be the winner?
Well, let‚Äôs find out!
Green!
 
Racing to the finish line 
Give it all you‚Äôve got
Green Light Green Light
Just don‚Äôt stop
Kii is helping Yii
What a lovely way to play
Kii and Yii have won!
Let‚Äôs shout Hooray!
Hooray!
 
Everybody come and play 
Who will win the game today?
Stop on red and go on green
Red Light, Green Light 123

That would be a treat!

No, no, no
We don‚Äôt want that to eat!
No, no, no
We‚Äôd like a different treat!

Pick a veg to eat
You might just find a veggie
Turns out to be a treat

Yes, yes, yes
This is good to eat
Yes, yes, yes
This really is a treat

Would you like more veggies
On your plate to eat?
Do you think that veggies
Now, could be a treat?

Yes, yes, yes
We both want veg to eat
Yes, yes, yes
These veggies are a treat!

Yes, yes, yes
We love to eat our veggies
Yes, yes, yes

When I want to see the pictures, she always lets me look

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
She helps us all to get along, and teaches us to share
She taught me always to be kind, and always to play fair

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was,
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
Sometimes I fall and hurt myself, and then I start to cry,
But she helps me to feel better, and helps me dry my eyes

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
She teaches us to dance, and she teaches us to sing
She teaches us some silly songs, and it‚Äôs my favorite thing

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
When I spill and make a mess, my teacher helps me clean
She‚Äôs the greatest teacher that I have ever seen

LYRICS:

Five Little Dumper Trucks,
Playing near to the muck, 
Splashing and spraying with their wheels. Yuk Yuk!

One dumped a load of dust,
So they all huffed and puffed,
Now there are four more dumper trucks.  Brum Brum!

Four Little Dumper Trucks ,
Playing Near to the Muck.
Splashing and spraying with their wheels. Yuk Yuk!

One truck, he left the group,
And drove straight in the poop!
Now there are four more dumper trucks.  Pooey!

Three little Dumper Trucks,
Playing near to the muck,
Splashing and spraying with their wheels. Yuk Yuk!

One truck forgot to brake,
And fell in the smelly lake,
Now there are two more dumper trucks.  So slimy!

Two little dumper trucks,
Playing near to the muck
Splashing and spraying with their wheels. Yuk Yuk!

One drove a bit too far,
Got stuck in the sticky tar,
Now there is one more dumper truck. Squelch Squelch.

One little dumper truck,
Playing near to the muck
Splashing and spraying with her wheels. Yuk Yuk!

She turned and gave smile,
Then crashed in the garbage pile,
Now there are no more dumper trucks. So Stinky!

Welcome to my truck wash,
It‚Äôs time to splish and splosh,
Splashing and spraying all the dirt! Wash Wash!

Drive all the way right through,
And we‚Äôll wash the muck off you,
Now you are oh so sparkly clean. So Shiny!

Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Look who‚Äôs passing, it‚Äôs dear, little Scout
She‚Äôll think of a way, now, to get Buster out
Scout get going and follow the trail
Get Buster out of jail!

Stop that bandit, Bandit the bus
He‚Äôs breaking the law and he‚Äôs causing a fuss
Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Look who‚Äôs stolen, a little bit more
Bandit the bus, you have broken the law!
Scout was clever and followed the trail
She got Buster out of jail!

Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Yes, you ended up in jail!

Once there was a very very speedy hare
Once there was a very very speedy hare
He would brag from near and far 
That he was faster than a car
Oh yes, one time there was a very speedy hare

The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so fast in running shoes,
Then there‚Äôs no way that you can lose,‚Äù
Oh yes, the tortoise said to Hare ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race‚Äù

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

All the animals came down to see them run
All the animals came down to see them run
With a bell the race began
And fast away the quick hare ran
Oh yes, the animals came down to see them run

The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
Since the hare so quickly sped,
He had by now run far ahead
Oh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
Since he thought he couldn‚Äôt lose,
He laid right down to take a snooze
Oh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win

The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
He passed by the sleeping hare,
Who kept on snoring, unaware
Oh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
The sleepy hare woke up and ran
As fast as speedy quick hares can
Oh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line

Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Oh yes the hare was very fast
But even so, he came in last
Oh yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race

Maybe I can help
We spiders love to climb

I‚Äôll give another try 

I‚Äôm a little worried, the fire pole is tall 
I‚Äôm afraid to climb up, 
what happens if I fall? 
Hello little spider 
Do you like to climb? 
Can we go together 
Would you like to try?

We will go together, 
Up the pole so tall
We will keep on trying,
Even if we fall
We will climb the firepole
We will climb up high
Easy, peasy, one, two, three, 
Up, up to the sky

Lyrics:

Who‚Äôs that bus painted yellow ?
It‚Äôs Buster but he‚Äôs lost his glow
A coat of paint will make you shine
A coat of paint and you‚Äôll look fine
A coat of paint will do the trick
But which colour will Buster pick?

Red green yellow blue, 
Pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so red
It‚Äôs Buster but he‚Äôs red instead
Maybe red is not your colour
Go back Buster try another

Red green yellow blue, 
Pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so Blue?
Uh-oh blue is just not you

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who's that Bus painted so green?
Buster [chuckle] you don‚Äôt seem keen

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so Pink?
It's back to the paint shop I think

So many colours in a row
Colours like a bright rainbow

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

A coat of paint made me shine
A coat of paint and I look fine
A coat of paint did the trick
And yellow is the one i picked!

Where is our class pet?
Oh, where could she be?
We‚Äôre looking and looking  
Searching for clues
Where is...
Jelly Bean?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings  

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

Jelly Bean!

This is our class pet
We found Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
She‚Äôs cuddly and sweet!

Don‚Äôt forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Buster isn‚Äôt happy when he goes to eat
He doesn‚Äôt want to try a healthier treat
Robin! You need to help your friend
He wants to see that Buster will be on the mend

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don‚Äôt forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Amber‚Äôs here to help, it‚Äôs such a relief
She shows him how to take care of his teeth

That eating healthy is a lovely idea
And going to the dentist isn‚Äôt something to fear

And to keep your smile so shiny and white
Brush your teeth with toothpaste morning and night

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don‚Äôt forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Lyrics:

Look who‚Äôs stealing, candy from the shop
It‚Äôs Bandit the Bus and he‚Äôs not going to stop
Go, go Ottis, follow the trail
You‚Äôve gotta put him in jail

Stop that bandit, Bandit the bus
He‚Äôs breaking the law and he‚Äôs causing a fuss
Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Look who‚Äôs noticed, candy near the door
It‚Äôs Buster the bus and he‚Äôs eating some more
No, no Ottis ‚Äì just follow the trail
Don‚Äôt put the wrong bus in jail

Stop that bandit, Bandit the bus
He‚Äôs breaking the law and he‚Äôs causing a fuss
Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Look who‚Äôs passing, it‚Äôs dear, little Scout
She‚Äôll think of a way, now, to get Buster out
Scout get going and follow the trail
Get Buster out of jail!

Stop that bandit, Bandit the bus
He‚Äôs breaking the law and he‚Äôs causing a fuss
Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Look who‚Äôs stolen, a little bit more
Bandit the bus, you have broken the law!
Scout was clever and followed the trail
She got Buster out of jail!

Stop, stop Bandit! We‚Äôre right on your tail
You‚Äôre gonna end up in jail!

Yes, you ended up in jail!

If someone is hurt we stop to help
Stop to help, Stop to help
If someone is hurt we stop to help
To get you up and playing

The doctor is here to check your knee
Check your knee, Check your knee
Doctor knows how to patch you up
So you can play again
So you can play again

If your tummy hurts we call the nurse
Call the nurse, call the nurse
The medicine takes the ouchie away
To make you feel better
To make you feel better

The ambulance has a bright red light
Bright red light, bright red light
The siren means help is on the way
To make sure you‚Äôre okay
To make sure you‚Äôre okay

A friend fell down and bumped her head
Bumped her head, bumped her head
The doctor gets ice in the ambulance
To make the boo boo better
To make the boo boo better

Someone over there just Scraped his arm
Scraped his arm scraped his arm
The nurse knows how to wrap it up
So you can play again
So you can play again

Everyone outside is feeling great
Feeling great, feeling great
The doctor and nurse helped all their friends
To make them feel better
To make them feel better

Lyrics:

Who‚Äôs that bus painted yellow?
It‚Äôs Buster but he‚Äôs lost his glow
A coat of paint will make you shine
A coat of paint and you‚Äôll look fine
A coat of paint will do the trick
But which colour will Buster pick?

Red green yellow blue, 
Pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 
Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so red
It‚Äôs Buster but he‚Äôs red instead
Maybe red is not your colour
Go back Buster try another

Red green yellow blue, 
Pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so Blue?
Uh-oh blue is just not you

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who's that Bus painted so green?
Buster [chuckle] you don‚Äôt seem keen

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

Who‚Äôs that Bus painted so Pink?
It's back to the paint shop I think

So many colours in a row
Colours like a bright rainbow

Red green yellow blue, 
pink or purple too
What will Buster do? 

A coat of paint made me shine
A coat of paint and I look fine
A coat of paint did the trick
And yellow is the one i picked!

Reading a book
Is so much fun
And there‚Äôs a book for everyone
Open up a book and you will find
A story comes to life!

I love to read westerns
With cowboys on the range
Riding‚Äô round on horses
Is the cowboy way
Open up a book and you will find
A story comes TO LIFE

I love adventures
With dragons in the sky
Flying over castles 
Looking down from way up high!
Open up a book and you will find
A story comes TO LIFE

I love books about space
And rockets in the stars
It‚Äôs time to blast off 
For a flight to Mars!
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 
BLAST OFF!!
Try another book
And you will find
A story Comes to life

Fairy tales 
Are the stories for me!
Skipping through the forest
With birdies in the trees!
Open up a book and you will find
A story comes TO LIFE
  
There are books
For everyone
I can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow
When we read a different one
We can read every day 
And every night
On Lellobee city farm

You Can Ride A Bike
 
Yeah I love to ride my bike
I can ride whenever I like
Hey hey hey
I‚Äôm gonna ride my bike today!
 
Let‚Äôs take this dusty bike
Clean it up so it looks real nice
Pump up the tires 
Give it a paint
Add some windmills
That‚Äôll be great 
 
Yeah I love to ride my bike
I can ride whenever I like
Hey hey hey
I‚Äôm gonna ride my bike today!
 
My bike has an awesome bell
I love to ring it - can‚Äôt you tell? 
My bell will keep me safe and sound
Cause when it dings, people turn around! 
 
Yeah I love to ride my bike
I can ride whenever I like
Hey hey hey
I‚Äôm gonna ride my bike today!
 
My bike has wheels that spin spin spin
When I race they help me win win win
The wheels on the bus go round and round
They almost lift me off the ground
 
BRIDGE
How bout my handlebars? 
They help me steer!
How bout my pedals? 
They turn the gears!
Riding your bike is good for the Earth
Cause it doesn‚Äôt need fuel to make it work‚Ä¶
 
(Who needs fuel when you have legs‚Ä¶?)
 
Yeah I love to ride my bike
I can ride whenever I like
Hey hey hey
I‚Äôm gonna ride my bike today!
 
I ride my bike all over the farm
Ride so fast and ride so far
Hey hey hey
I‚Äôm gonna ride my bike today!

Lyrics:

Who loves to paint?
(We love to paint!) 
I said Who loves to paint?
(We all love to paint!)
So many colors we can choose!
Which color do you want to use?
 
RED!
Like an apple so ripe
Or a fire truck with flashing lights
 
BLUE! 
Now that‚Äôs really cool
Like the water in the ocean or the water in a pool
 
MIX them together
What do you see? 
Purple!
(PURPLE)
Uh huh!
 
Now rap along with me
Who loves to paint?
(We love to paint!) 
I said Who loves to paint?
(We all love to paint!)
 
YELLOW!
Like a bus, for you and me!
Or a lemon on a lemon tree
 
RED! 
Again - like an apple so ripe
Or a fire truck with flashing lights!
 
Put them together
What do you see? 
Orange!
(Orange!)
Uh huh!
Now rap along with me
 
Who loves to paint?
(We love to paint!) 
I said Who loves to paint?
(We all love to paint!)
So many colors we can choose!
Which color do you want to use?
 
GREEN! 
Like a frog jumping up and down
Or a turtle crawling on the ground
WHITE!
Just like piano keys
BLACK! 
Like the keys that are in-between!
 
STOP
Let‚Äôs mix it up
With all these different colors, we can make some cool stuff
 
Red and White!? 
(Red and White!)
Makes Pink - that‚Äôs right!
(Pink that‚Äôs right!)
Yellow and Blue? 
(Yellow and Blue!)
That‚Äôs green - so cool! (So cool!)
Now take all the colors in the whole wide town
(All the colors, in the town!)
What do you get? (what do you get?)
Brown Brown Brown!! 
 
Who loves to paint?
(We love to paint!) 
I said Who loves to paint?
(We all love to paint!)
We used so many colors today
Color is the Lellobee way

See the lions there ‚Äúwoohoo!‚Äù
I love to be at the zoo
Let‚Äôs learn something new

Lions run and jump real fast
You can hear them roar 
Lions have such awesome manes
The cubs have tiny claws

I love to be at the zoo
See the giraffes ‚Äútheir neck‚Äôs so long!‚Äù
Giraffes have spotty patterns too
Let‚Äôs learn something new

Giraffes are the tallest animals
They reach the highest trees
That is lucky for giraffes
Because they only eat leaves

Buster sees a little cat
The sight makes him happy, so that
He runs up to play
The cat runs away
Where have you gone little cat?
 
Never give up on a friend
Yes, you will succeed in the end
At the end of the day
You will find a way
Never give up on a friend
 
The little cat runs up a tree
She climbs up as high as can be
She cannot get down
Back safe to the ground
How will she get down the tree?
 
Never give up on a friend
Yes, you will succeed in the end
At the end of the day
You will find a way
Never give up on a friend

Never give up on a friend
Yes, you will succeed in the end
At the end of the day
You will find a way
Never give up on a friend
 
Buster has had some bad luck
He fetches a red fire truck
But the little cat stays
‚ÄòCos she is afraid
It‚Äôs time for a little good luck
 
Never give up on a friend
Yes, you will succeed in the end
At the end of the day
You did find a way
You never gave up on a friend

Well pick it up and make a sound!

She makes it OK
The pain goes away

She even helps when I play soccer
If the ball goes off track
She‚Äôll go get it back
There‚Äôs no one else quite like my mummy

I love mommy

We have a good time when we‚Äôre painting
I always have fun
When painting with mom
There‚Äôs no one else quite like my mummy

At night-time she‚Äôll tell me a story
She‚Äôll turn out the light
And kiss me goodnight
There‚Äôs no one else quite like my mummy

I really love my mommy and I want to say
I think she‚Äôs the best in every single way
So I wrote a card to let her know
She‚Äôs a super mommy, yes a superhero!

My mommy makes me happy when I‚Äôm sad sad sad 
She makes me giggle and then I‚Äôm glad glad glad
She makes all the grey clouds go away 
Yeah she really knows how to brighten my day

I really love my mommy and in my eyes 
She is a superhero dressed in disguise
She's always around to save the day
I don‚Äôt worry when my mommy‚Äôs on the way 

So come on everybody let‚Äôs all cheer cheer cheer

Oh Dear, you

You‚Äôll be good as new again
So

Oh Dear, you

You felt sad for a little while
But you‚Äôre smiling again

Watch out Buster

Watch out Buster
He isn‚Äôt here to play
And he‚Äôs causing trouble
So, who can save the day?
We need Super Buster
To chase him far away

Super Buster
Flying through the air
Super Buster
You know that he‚Äôll be there
If a friend‚Äôs in trouble
He‚Äôs here to save the day
Yes, it‚Äôs Super Buster
He‚Äôs here to help. HOORAY

Watch out Ottis
Bandit‚Äôs on his way
Watch out Ottis
He isn‚Äôt here to play
And he‚Äôs causing trouble
So, who can save the day?
We need Super Buster
To chase him far away

Super Buster
Flying through the air
Super Buster
You know that he‚Äôll be there
If a friend‚Äôs in trouble
He‚Äôs here to save the day
Yes, it‚Äôs Super Buster
He‚Äôs here to help. HOORAY

Watch out Scout
Bandit‚Äôs on his way
Watch out Scout
He isn‚Äôt here to play
And he‚Äôs causing trouble
So, who can save the day?
We need Super Buster
To chase him far away

So, she‚Äôll have to go fetch help
 
Buster, Buster here‚Äôs the plan
Friends will pull you if they can
Hang on tightly to a rope
We can do this! (Well, we hope!)
With some pushing from behind
We will help you, you‚Äôll be fine
 
Buster, Buster hold on tight
Friends will pull with all their might
Where has Scout gone? Where‚Äôs she been?
Gone to put the plug back in
Buster‚Äôs free now in the end
Thanks to all his lovely friends!

Lyrics:

Playing outside 
Is so much fun 
But there‚Äôs something that we have to do 
Now that we‚Äôre done 

Our hands are dirty
So before we eat 
We have to make sure 
Our hands are clean 

Let‚Äôs wash our hands! 
It only takes 20 seconds!

Turn on the tap (turn on the tap!)
Get your hands wet (get your hands wet)
Now grab the soap (grab the soap!)
Don‚Äôt you forget to 
Scrub Scrub Scrub 
Scrub a dub dub
Make a lot of soapy suds 
Now rinse 
And you‚Äôll see 
Your hands are squeaky clean!

If your playing 
With your pet 
There is something 
You can‚Äôt forget 

Before you touch 
Your mouth, eyes, or nose 
Your hands need washing 
You know how it goes!! ‚Ä¶. 

Turn on the tap (turn on the tap!)
Get your hands wet (get your hands wet)
Now grab the soap (grab the soap!)
Don‚Äôt you forget to 
Scrub Scrub Scrub 
Scrub a dub dub
Make a lot of soapy suds 
Now rinse (Rinse!)
And you‚Äôll see (You‚Äôll see!)
Your hands are squeaky clean! (That‚Äôs right!)

EVERYBODY! 

Turn on the tap (turn on the tap!)
Get your hands wet (get your hands wet)
Now grab the soap (grab the soap!)
Don‚Äôt you forget to 
Scrub Scrub Scrub 
Scrub a dub dub
Make a lot of soapy suds 
Now rinse (Rinse!)
And you‚Äôll see (You‚Äôll see!)
Your hands are squeaky clean! (That‚Äôs right!)

On Lellobee farm, where good things grow! 

Don‚Äôt forget to dry ‚Äòem off with the towel!

Throwing you aside
And is off, on the double

Watch out Digger

Knocking down the blocks
And is off, on the double

What‚Äôs going on around here today?
There‚Äôs a naughty robot Buster

Watch out Buster

Your friends are blaming you
They don‚Äôt know you have a double.

Once there was a very very speedy hare
Once there was a very very speedy hare
He would brag from near and far 
That he was faster than a car
Oh yes, one time there was a very speedy hare

The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so fast in running shoes,
Then there‚Äôs no way that you can lose,‚Äù
Oh yes, the tortoise said to Hare ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race‚Äù

All the animals came down to see them run
All the animals came down to see them run
With a bell the race began
And fast away the quick hare ran
Oh yes, the animals came down to see them run

The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
Since the hare so quickly sped,
He had by now run far ahead
Oh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along

The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
Since he thought he couldn‚Äôt lose,
He laid right down to take a snooze
Oh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win

The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
He passed by the sleeping hare,
Who kept on snoring, unaware
Oh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road

Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
The sleepy hare woke up and ran
As fast as speedy quick hares can
Oh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line

Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Oh yes the hare was very fast
But even so, he came in last
Oh yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 

Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

Going to the doctors
Going to the doctors
Gonna get myself checked
Gonna get my health checked

I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!
Doctors really care!
Doctors really care! 
Take temperature, take temperature!

It's a little high, it's a little high
That's quite normal, that's quite normal
When you're feeling ill, when you're feeling ill
Let's check your breathing, let's check your breathing

Going to the doctors
Going to the doctors
Gonna get myself checked
Gonna get my health checked

I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!
Doctors really care!
Doctors really care! 
Measure pulse, measure pulse

It's a little fast, it's a little fast
That's quite normal, that's quite normal
When you're feeling ill, when you're feeling ill
Check your throat, check your throat

Going to the doctors

Gonna get myself checked
Gonna get my health checked
 
I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!

Pick a veg to eat
You might just find a veggie
Turns out to be a treat

Yes, yes, yes
This is good to eat
Yes, yes, yes
This really is a treat

Would you like more veggies
On your plate to eat?
Do you think that veggies
Now, could be a treat?

Yes, yes, yes
We both want veg to eat
Yes, yes, yes
These veggies are a treat!

Yes, yes, yes
We love to eat our veggies
Yes, yes, yes

Lyrics:

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
It's rolling on the tracks gonna get there fast. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
I could spend all day watching you go choo choo!

Oh all across the country there are many train tracks and so many trains that roll on through.
I can only imagine how much fun I'd be having if I was riding on the caboose.
I'd try to count all the train cars, but there are so many flying by.
One. Two. Three. Four.
And there's even more. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
It's rolling on the tracks gonna get there fast. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
I could spend all day watching you go choo choo!

Some trains are made to transport people.
I've been on one, how about you?
Some move cargo miles and miles,
Some move oil or fruit.
Every time a train goes by, I wonder what could be inside. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
It's rolling on the tracks gonna get there fast. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
I could spend all day watching you go choo choo!

Trains are powered by a locomotive,
Now let's do the locomotive locomotion.
You pull the whole train all by yourself,
And you only got to say one thing;

Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka,
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka,
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka,
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka
Chuka Chuka Chuka Chuka
Chaaaa! 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
It's rolling on the tracks gonna get there fast. 

Choo choo! Here comes the train,
Choo choo! Here comes the train.
I could spend all day watching you go choo choo!

All buster needs is a christmas tree 
To shine so big and bright!

So quickly come with me
Says a robin joyously
I know the perfect place to find
A brilliant christmas tree

So the robin takes the lead
Flying high above at speed
Buster follows below, 
Driving through the thick white snow

And there they find the Christmas tree!
Standing up so tall,
A perfect tree to decorate 
with lights and bright baubles

Here it is, the christmas tree
It's going to look so great
Drive it home to decorate
Oh Buster just can‚Äôt wait.

Driving through the snow
With a christmas tree in tow
Be careful Buster the bus!
Steady as you go!

The christmas tree has slipped
And is rolling, falling down
Quickly buster! Chase that tree
All the way back through the town!

Oh Chase that falling christmas tree
Its tumbling through the snow
Tangling up with christmas lights 
Catch up with it oh no!

Oh Chase that falling christmas tree 
Its flying through the sky!
Buster races through the snow
Looking up at the tree so high!

The tree is falling down 
So fast towards the ground!
But luck has come around!
Because its landed safe and sound!

Oh christmas tree you look!
So Beautiful and Bright!
Buster the bus is a lucky little bus
Merry christmas and goodnight!

There‚Äôs an apple

To see it on my dinner plate! 

Don‚Äôt forget
At Harvest Time

What‚Äôs yours is mine!!

Shake shake the tree
Shake shake the tree
An apple for you 
An apple for me!

Won‚Äôt you shake a tree with me 
So we can eat all day!

How bout an orange!?
They‚Äôre big and bright!
I‚Äôve never seen such a tasty sight! 

Don‚Äôt forget
At Harvest Time 
We have to share 
What‚Äôs yours is mine!!

Shake shake the tree
Shake shake the tree
An orange for you

The fruit is ripe
Yes, it‚Äôs harvest time

Look! Bananas!

Like monkeys do! 

Don‚Äôt forget

Lyrics:

Nobody wants a toothache
So wet your toothbrush and get your toothpaste
Put on a dab about the size of a pea 
Now get your toothbrush ready and follow me!
Ok! We have two minutes, get ready!

Let's make some circles, circles, circles, circles, circles!
Circles on all sides of your teeth
Circles on this side, circles on that
Circles on the top, where you chew on snacks
Gotta get rid of that plaque

There are germs living in your mouth
Gotta get them out!
And that's why we brush our teeth

Come on! Brush those teeth
Go on! Scrub them clean
Come on! Make those pearly whites shine

Ok! We're halfway there, a little bit longer!

Let's make some MORE circles, circles, circles, circles, circles!
Circles on all sides of your teeth
Brushing makes your breath smell super nice
Gotta make your smile as white as rice
So I love brushing my teeth!

Oh don't forget to brush your gums!
And don't forget your tongue!
Now we are almost done

Let's go front, back, side to side
Front, back and side to side
Front, back, side to side
Front, back and side to side

Come on! Brush those teeth
Go on! Scrub them clean
Come on! Make those pearly whites shine

Come on! Brush those teeth
Go on! Scrub them clean
Come on! Make those pearly whites shine

Oh I love brushing my teeth!

Buster loves the winter
What a lovely day
He cannot wait to jump into the snow and play

Buster loves the snowflakes
Falling to the ground
Dancing in the air they never make a sound

Buster loves the winter
Having lots of fun
Wrapping up and playing in the winter sun

Buster loves the icicles
Sparkling in the light
Twinkling in the sun. Oh, what a lovely sight

Buster loves the reindeer
Watch them being fed
(Hey) That one over there has got a nose that‚Äôs red!

Buster loves the winter
Having lots of fun
Wrapping up and playing in the winter sun

Buster loves the cold days
Playing on the ice
But being ‚ÄòBuster ice-cube‚Äô isn‚Äôt all that nice

Buster doesn‚Äôt love this
So, he calls to Scout
To go get Ashley Fire-truck to help him out

Buster loves the winter
Having lots of fun
Wrapping up and playing in the winter sun

Buster loves the winter
Ashley saved the day
She got poor Buster out so now they all can play!

Buster loves the winter
Having lots of fun
Wrapping up and playing in the winter sun!

Help your skis to make an A
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!

Ride the magic carpet up
Then we‚Äôll ski down from the top 
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!

It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side
On a white and snowy ride
Sliding down the bunny slope 
Soaring, smiling wide

Let‚Äôs go down the bunny slope 
Not too fast and not too slow
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!

Lyrics:

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

Verse 1
The wrench tightens pipes going clang clang
A hammer hits a nail going bang bang bang
A drill is making holes going zzz zzzz
When you‚Äôre working with tools you hear all kinds of things 

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

You hear thuds and squeaks, cracks and rings
When you‚Äôre working with tools you hear all kinds of things 
You hear bangs and booms, clangs and zings
When you‚Äôre working with tools you hear all kinds of things

Verse 2 
Cutting wires with some pliers going snip snip
Cutting paper with some scissors going clip clip
When you're working with tools you've got to be real safe
By wearing gloves on your hands and goggles on your face

Spoken: 
And boys and girls when you're working with tools
Always follow mom and dad‚Äôs safety rules.

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

When you‚Äôre working with tools, working with tools
You hear all kinds of things

You hear thuds and squeaks, cracks and rings
When you‚Äôre working with tools you hear all kinds of things 
You hear bangs and booms, clangs and zings
When you‚Äôre working with tools you hear all kinds of things

Look at what he‚Äôs seen!

Ashley Fire Truck

So, Buster can become
The best that he can be

When the fire is hot
Quickly move away
Call your local fire truck 
To come and save the day

Look at Buster Bus
Doesn‚Äôt he look smart?
With a ladder and a hose
He really looks the part

Hear that fire alarm!
Ashley‚Äôs called away!
Buster wants to go with her
But Ashley makes him stay.

Oh gosh, Tony Truck
What has happened here?
Buster put the fire out!
It‚Äôs burning very near!

When the fire is hot
Quickly move away
Call your local fire truck 
To come and save the day

Robin flies to help
Ashley‚Äôs helping too
Together they can put it out
And that‚Äôs just what they do

When the fire is hot
Quickly move away
Call your local fire truck 
To come and save the day

Here are Buster‚Äôs friends
Look at what they‚Äôve seen
Buster as a fire truck
No longer is a dream!

Robin thinks the dentist is the place to go
But Buster is frightened, he just won‚Äôt go

Yummy candy is such a nice treat

Use your toothbrush every day!

Buster isn‚Äôt happy when he goes to eat
He doesn‚Äôt want to try a healthier treat
Robin! You need to help your friend
He wants to see that Buster will be on the mend

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don‚Äôt forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

Amber‚Äôs here to help, it‚Äôs such a relief
She shows him how to take care of his teeth

That eating healthy is a lovely idea
And going to the dentist isn‚Äôt something to fear

And to keep your smile so shiny and white
Brush your teeth with toothpaste morning and night

Yummy candy is such a nice treat
Everybody likes to munch on something sweet
Don‚Äôt forget to take good care of your teeth
Use your toothbrush every day!

You‚Äôll be happy again

Oh Dear, you

You tried to jump - instead
You went and bumped your head

The three little kittens, they lost their mittens,
And they began to cry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we sadly fear,
Our mittens we have lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Lost your mittens?  You naughty kittens,
Then you shall have no pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have no pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens, they found their mittens,
And they began to cry,
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have found!‚Äù
‚ÄúPut on your mittens, you silly kittens,
And you shall have some pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have some pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens put on their mittens
And soon ate up the pie.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we greatly fear,
Our mittens we have soiled.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Soiled your mittens?  You naughty kittens!‚Äù
Then they began to sigh.
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then they began to sigh.

The three little kittens, they washed their mittens
And hung them out to dry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have washed.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Washed your mittens?  Such good little kittens,
I smell a wolf close by.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
We smell a wolf close by.‚Äù

Hold on tight we wont be long,
Straight to the rescue!

Little robin have you seen Buster bus where has he been?
Little robin fly up high, Robin to the rescue!

Scout and Robin, Digley too,
Are searching high and searching low,
Coming to the rescue!

There he is! Buster is found,
In the mud, no one around,
Little robin we need help to start the rescue!

Maybe red is not your colour

Red green yellow blue,

So many colours in a row
Colours like a bright rainbow

Red green yellow blue,

Yes! it‚Äôs time to play!

Splish Splash Underwater
It‚Äôs the Blippi way
To learn and play all day!""

It‚Äôs time for your shot today
Here comes the doctor, hear him say! 
When the jab is done, you will be
Safe and well and healthy, lalalalalalala

Here‚Äôs the doctor, he is so very kind
It‚Äôs time for your jab, you will be fine
A jab will keep you safe every day
And when it‚Äôs done, then you can play

It‚Äôs time for your shot today
Here comes the doctor, hear him say! 
When the jab is done, you will be
Safe and well and healthy, lalalalalalala

Here‚Äôs the doctor, he is so very kind
It‚Äôs time for your jab, you will be fine
The jab will keep sickness away
And when it‚Äôs done, then you can play

Now the jab is over, here‚Äôs a treat
A great big lollipop to eat!
You‚Äôve had your jab today
Well done, now it‚Äôs time to play lalalalalalala

Today my daddy took my bike
Removed the little wheels
So four wheels became just two
How different it now feels!

At first, I wobbled everywhere
But daddy was there to help
I got more and more confident
Until I did it by myself!

Bicycle! ......  Bicycle! 
Learn to ride on just 2 wheels!

It takes time to know what to do
And keep trying is the clue
It's the same for me and you!

Christmas is coming! What do you love about this special time of year?

Is it the snow that falls around you?
Is it the lights around the Christmas tree?
Is it the happiness we feel in the air?
Or is it spending time with family?

[Chorus]
Christmas is coming!
The holidays are here!
Christmas is coming!
Our favorite time of the year

Is it the love from all around?
Is it the presents under the Christmas tree?
Is it the food that tastes so good?
Or is it spending time with family?

Christmas is coming!
The holidays are here!

""Have you ever seen a train zooming down the track?
Clackity clackity, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack!
Or a very fast cheetah with spots so black
zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap!
A speed boat racing in water so fun
Rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm, rummm!
And a Dolphin loving to swim in the sun
Shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum, shum!

How about a fast plane flying so high?
fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!
Or a golden eagle diving down from the sky
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my!
A rocket speeding on it's way to the Moon
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
It's very fast and will be back soon
Soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon!""

Three green bottles standing on the wall
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall
There'll be two green bottles standing on the wall

Two green bottles standing on the wall
Two green bottles standing on the wall
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall
There'll be one green bottle standing on the wall

One green bottle standing on a wall
One green bottle standing on a wall
And if one green bottle should accidentally fall
There'll be no green bottles standing on a wall""

Lyrics:

""What's your favourite colour balloon?
Mine has to be red!
I like to carry it around
Floating above my head!

What's your favourite colour balloon? 
Mine has to be blue!
I like to carry it around
When I go to visit you

What's your favourite colour balloon?
Mine has to be yellow!
I like to carry it around
If you see me say ""Hello!""

What's your favourite colour balloon?
Mine has to be green!
I like to carry it around
It's the best balloon I've seen!

What's your favourite colour balloon?
Mine has to be purple!
I like to carry it around
And show it to my turtle!"""

Lyrics:

""One, two, three, four, five
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.

Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on my right.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.

Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on my right. """
